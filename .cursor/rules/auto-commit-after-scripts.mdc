# Auto-Commit After Script Execution

After successfully running any script in the `scripts/` directory, automatically create a git commit and push it.

## Workflow

1. Run the script as requested
2. If the script completes successfully (exit code 0):
   - Stage all changes: `git add -A`
   - Create a commit with a descriptive message about what the script did
   - Push to the current branch: `git push`
3. If the script fails, do NOT commit - report the error to the user first

## Commit Message Format

Use this format for auto-commits:

```
Run: <script-name>

<brief description of what the script accomplished>
```

Example:
```
Run: apply-size-enrichment.ts

Applied size enrichment updates to 15 accounts in the master CSV
```

## Important

- Only auto-commit after scripts in `scripts/` directory
- Do not commit if there are no changes after the script runs
- If push fails (e.g., no remote, auth issues), inform the user but don't treat it as a failure
