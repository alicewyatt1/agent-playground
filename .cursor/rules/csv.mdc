- Prefer CSV over other data formats when dealing with simple data
- csvkit and csvsql are installed - use them when querying CSV files

## Tool Selection for CSV Operations

**Use csvsql when:**
- Simple counts, filters, or aggregations
- Straightforward WHERE clauses
- Quick ad-hoc queries
- Read-only operations

**Use TypeScript/Python when:**
- Complex matching logic (e.g., checking multiple columns for 50 US state names)
- Data transformations or updates (csvsql is read-only)
- Regex-based matching
- Chaining multiple operations
- Accuracy is critical and conditions are complex

Always prioritize accuracy - if a query would require many LIKE clauses or complex logic in SQL, use TypeScript/Python instead.

DO NOT USE JSON FOR STORING TABULAR DATA. CSV is a much better format.
