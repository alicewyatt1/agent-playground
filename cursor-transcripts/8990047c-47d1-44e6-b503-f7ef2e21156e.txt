Here's what I can extract:

**Name:** Alice Wyatt
**Headline:** Fractional CMO & GTM Advisor | Forbes Council Member
**Current Company:** Alice Wyatt GTM Advisory
**Education:** Durham University
**Connections:** 500+
**Followers:** 5,712
**Location:** (likely NYC based on URL)

**Analytics (Private):**
- 565 profile views

Looking at her work history, she's currently running her own GTM advisory firm where she helps Series A+ companies with fractional marketing leadership, ABM strategy, and sales team design. Before that, she spent over three years at Codat, most recently as VP of Marketing starting in early 2023. At Adyen, I was promoted to lead their global demand generation efforts, building out a cross-functional team across events, ABM, and campaigns to expand the merchant pipeline. Before that, I was brought in from Bloomreach to head marketing for their Mid Market segment. At Bloomreach, I managed global demand generation, content and brand across multiple regions with a team of 12 reports, and previously led their global campaigns function. Now I'm looking at the education section—Durham University with a 2:1 in Natural Sciences, where I was involved in lacrosse and served as a course rep, plus my A-levels from St James. I also have some volunteer experience listed with The Wilderness Foundation.

I see I've been a leadership mentor at Durham since 2021. My skills include management and business development with various endorsements, and I've received recognition like being named a Top 30 Most Influential Fintech Marketer in 2025 and a BloomReach Excellence Award. I have recommendations from colleagues like Dan Gershfield and Sophie Caley, and I follow some top voices in the industry along with interests in BBC News and Durham University.

Now I'm looking at my other professional affiliations and learning channels—I'm involved with software and digital marketing business chambers, AI Marketing Connect, and I follow Andrew's Tech Events newsletter. I also attended St James Senior Girls' School before Durham University.

I'll search for each company on LinkedIn and check for connections. The best approach would be to use LinkedIn's search to look for people at each company.

- **3rd+:** Cathleen Pennington, Daniel Gillaspey, Kristin Limkemann, Tom Penaluna

Now let me search the next companies. Let me do them in parallel... actually, I can only navigate one browser at a time, so I'll do them sequentially.

- Chuck Tatosian (3rd+) - Principal Owner at CFT Consulting LLC

The other results seem to be people at other "consulting LLC" companies, not CFT Consulting specifically. So no 1st or 2nd degree connections at CFT Consulting LLC specifically.

Let me continue with the next company.

- All results are 3rd+ or LinkedIn Members (outside network). No 1st or 2nd degree connections found.

Done. Here's the summary across all six accounts:

## Connection Summary

|---|---|---|---|
| **CBE Companies** | None | 5 people | Stephanie Perry, Amanda King, Jordan Mulford, Jeff Stewart, Leslie Loofbourow |

### Key Highlights

- **Strongest connections:** ClearSource BPO and Clark Outsourcing -- you have 2nd-degree connections to senior leadership (CEO/Co-Founder level) at both.
- **Notable mutual connections:** At CBE Companies, Albert Smothers is a mutual connection linking you to 3 people. At ClearSource, you have mutual connections like Cliff Simon, Daniel Weiner, Jessica Chase, Dave Boyce, Michael Gonzalez Ross, and Lottie Unwin.
- **No connections:** CFT Consulting LLC and Convergent -- no 1st or 2nd degree connections found.

Continuing through the rest of the company list from the CSV.

With 43 companies total, checking each one individually would be tedious. I'm thinking about using LinkedIn's search with a company filter to find 1st-degree connections more efficiently—specifically using a URL pattern that limits results to direct connections only, which would save time if there are no matches to report.
That's a big list -- 43 companies. The most efficient approach is to search LinkedIn for each company filtered to **1st-degree connections only**. Let me work through them all.

assistant:
[Thinking] The results for "American Customer Care" (ACC Premier) show 1st-degree connections, but none of them seem to actually work at ACC Premier/American Customer Care. They appear to be people whose profiles contain "customer" and "care" in their descriptions. This is a false positive from LinkedIn's keyword search. I need to check if any of these people actually work at ACC Premier/American Customer Care.

Looking at the results:
- Amy Bouthilet - VP Global Talent at Alta Resources (not ACC Premier)
- Alfred Silverstein - CMO at Banana Exchange (not ACC Premier)
- Kate Crouch - People and Culture Director at Nourish Care (not ACC Premier)


- Kate Shafer - Director at Cardinal Health (not ACC Premier)
- Ryan Mason - VP Sales at AT&T (not ACC Premier)
- Riti Shah - at Cedar/McKinsey (not ACC Premier)
- Jessica Lyn Zall - CMO/Founder at Marathon Advisory (not ACC Premier)
- Eli Ruffa-Ward - at Supplemental Health Care (not ACC Premier)
- Garrath Robinson - at DURINDAL/BOD Care (not ACC Premier)
- Génesis Miranda Longo - at Shopify (not ACC Premier)

The search is pulling in too many false positives because the keywords are matching people in adjacent industries rather than actual ACC Premier employees.

I should try a more targeted approach—either searching directly for "ACC Premier" as a company name or using a company filter if available. Generic terms like "American Customer Care" cast too wide a net, so I need to be more precise with my search strategy and verify that results actually belong to the company I'm looking for.
Those results for "American Customer Care" are mostly false positives - none of those people actually work at ACC Premier. The search matched "customer" and "care" in many profiles. Let me use more specific search terms and work through this more efficiently. I'll search for each company and carefully verify results.
