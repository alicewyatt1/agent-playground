Let's scrape my LinkedIn page - use the browser to go to https://www.linkedin.com/in/alice-wyatt-nyc/

The user wants to scrape their LinkedIn page using the browser. They've provided the URL: https://www.linkedin.com/in/alice-wyatt-nyc/

I should use the browser MCP tool to navigate to this page. Let me check what browser tools are available - the user mentioned "use the browser" so I need to find the browser MCP tools. Looking at my available tools, I don't see a direct "browser" or "mcp_browsermcp" tool in the list. Let me look at what I have:

- codebase_search
- run_terminal_cmd
- grep
- read_file
- list_dir
- web_search
- update_memory
- list_mcp_resources
- fetch_mcp_resource
- mcp_perplexity-ask_perplexity_ask
- mcp_perplexity-ask_perplexity_research
- mcp_perplexity-ask_perplexity_reason
- mcp_perplexity-ask_perplexity_search
- mcp_web_fetch

The project guidelines mention "Use the `web_search` and `mcp_browsermcp` tools to get data from the web" - so there's a reference to mcp_browsermcp but I don't see it in my available tools list. Maybe it's available under a different name or maybe I need to try using it.

Actually wait - the user said "use the browser". The rules say "Use the `web_search` and `mcp_browsermcp` tools" - so mcp_browsermcp might be a tool that exists. But in my function list I don't have mcp_browsermcp. I have mcp_web_fetch which can fetch URL content.

Let me try mcp_web_fetch first to get the LinkedIn page content. That might work for "scraping" in the sense of getting the page content. However, LinkedIn pages are typically heavily JavaScript-rendered and often require authentication, so mcp_web_fetch might return a login wall or minimal content.

I'll try mcp_web_fetch on the LinkedIn URL to see what we get. If the user specifically asked for "the browser", they might have a browser MCP server configured - perhaps the tool name is different. I'll try the fetch first and report what we get.
