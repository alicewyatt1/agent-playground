I want you to take this list of accounts and give me the city that every HQ is in. I want the format to be in columns, so you have first name of company, then in alphabetical order, just as I've pasted it, you then have HQ, you then have state, and then you have city as a new column. 
</user_query>

The user has pasted a list of BPO/contact center companies with columns that appear to be: Company Name, some URL (outsourceaccelerator or clutch), company website, United States, State.

They want me to:
1. Take this list of accounts
2. Add the city for each company's HQ
3. Format as columns: Company name (first), then the existing columns in alphabetical order as pasted, then HQ, then State, then City as a new column

Looking at the pasted data more carefully - it seems like the columns might be:
- Company name
- URL (clutch or outsource accelerator)
- Website
- Country (United States)
- State

They want: Company name, then columns in order as pasted, then HQ, then State, then City.

Wait, re-reading again: "first name of company, then in alphabetical order, just as I've pasted it, you then have HQ, you then have state, and then you have city as a new column."

So the order is:
1. Company name (first)
2. Then the other columns as pasted (in the order they have them - which might be: profile URL, website, country, state?)
3. HQ (maybe they mean headquarters - could be the same as website or a physical address?)
4. State
5. City (new - need to look up)

Actually re-reading again - "first name of company, then in alphabetical order, just as I've pasted it" - I think they mean keep the companies in alphabetical order by name (which the list mostly is), and the column order should be: Company name, then the columns they had (profile URL, website, country, state), then add HQ, then State, then City.

Or maybe: Company | (existing cols) | HQ | State | City. And "HQ" might mean the headquarters location (city/state) or a column header. Adding "city" as new column means I need to find the city for each.

I'll need to look up the headquarters city for each of these companies. Let me first read the current CSV file to see its structure, then I'll need to research each company's HQ city.

Let me read the existing CSV and the project rules for CSV format.

The current CSV has different columns. The user pasted a new list in their message - that list has: Company, Profile URL (clutch/outsourceaccelerator), Website, United States, State. They want the output to have: Company name, then those columns in order, then HQ, then State, then City.

So the target format is:
Company, Profile URL, Website, Country, State, HQ, City

Actually re-reading again: "first name of company, then in alphabetical order, just as I've pasted it, you then have HQ, you then have state, and then you have city as a new column."

I think they mean:
1. Company name (first column)
2. Then the rest of the columns as they pasted (profile URL, website, country, state)
3. Then add "HQ" column
4. Then "State" (maybe they want state repeated or they mean state then city?)
5. Then "City" as new column

So: Company | Profile URL | Website | Country | State | City (and maybe HQ is the city+state or address?). I'll interpret as: we need to add City. So columns: Company, Profile URL, Website, Country, State, City. "HQ" might mean the headquarters - so maybe HQ is a column that says the HQ location (city, state)? So: Company, Profile URL, Website, Country, State, City. I'll use: Company, Profile URL, Website, Country, State, City. If they said "HQ" as a column maybe it's "HQ" = "City, State" or just the city. I'll add City as the new column and if they want HQ they can clarify. Actually re-read one more time: "you have first name of company, then in alphabetical order, just as I've pasted it, you then have HQ, you then have state, and then you have city as a new column."

So column order: Company, (existing columns in order as pasted), HQ, State, City. So maybe they have State already in the pasted data, so: Company, URL, Website, Country, State, HQ, City? That would duplicate state. More likely: Company, URL, Website, Country, State, City - and "HQ" might mean the headquarters location (which we're filling in with city). So I'll do: Company, Profile URL, Website, Country, State, City. I'll add a header row. Let me parse the user's pasted data and look up each city.

I now have all cities:
- Momentum Worldwide: New York (300 Vesey St, NYC)
- MyOutDesk: Sacramento, California
- Netsmartz: Rochester, NY (or Pittsford - 1250 Pittsford Victor Road, Pittsford NY 14534 - Pittsford is suburb of Rochester, I'll use Pittsford or Rochester - company says "Headquartered in Rochester, NY" and "Pittsford, NY" for the address - I'll use Rochester as the city since that's what they say)
- NexRep: Portland, Maine
- Office Beacon: Redondo Beach, California (407 N Pacific Coast Hwy - contact says Redondo Beach; OA says Manhattan Beach - I'll use Redondo Beach from contact page)
- Percepta: Dearborn, Michigan
- Personiv: Austin, Texas
- Quatrro: Marietta, Georgia
- Remote CoWorker: Pompano Beach, Florida

For Netsmartz - they say "Headquartered in Rochester, NY" and address is "1250 Pittsford Victor Road, Pittsford, NY". Pittsford is a suburb. I'll use Rochester as that's the HQ city they state.

For Go Answer - they said "New York" and DesignRush had Garden City, NY. I'll use New York for simplicity or Garden City. User asked for "city" - I'll use the specific city: Garden City.

For Boldr - CB Insights said Long Beach, their connect page says Santa Monica for "Boldr HQ". I'll use Long Beach as that was the primary HQ in multiple sources.

Now let me build the full CSV. User wanted: Company name first, then columns in order as pasted (Profile URL, Website, Country, State), then HQ, then State, then City. Re-reading again - "first name of company, then in alphabetical order, just as I've pasted it, you then have HQ, you then have state, and then you have city as a new column."

So the columns in order: Company, (then the rest as pasted - which is Profile URL, Website, Country, State), HQ, State, City. So we have State twice if we include "State" as a column after HQ. I'll do: Company, Profile URL, Website, Country, State, City. That gives us company first, then the data as pasted (profile url, website, country, state), then city. They said "you then have HQ" - maybe HQ is a column header for "headquarters" and they want HQ location (city, state)? I'll do: Company, Profile URL, Website, Country, State, City. That's clean. If they want "HQ" as a column I could add "HQ" with value like "City, State" but that's redundant with State and City. I'll go with Company, Profile URL, Website, Country, State, City.

I've created the CSV. I simplified the Helpware website URL (removed the long UTM string from the user's paste). Let me double-check - the user had "Boldr, Inc." with a comma; I used "Boldr Inc." to avoid CSV issues. Actually in CSV we need to quote fields that contain commas. Let me check - "Boldr, Inc." would need to be "Boldr, Inc." in quotes in CSV. I'll update to keep company names as the user had them and use proper CSV quoting where needed.

Looking at the user's list again - they had:
- "Boldr, Inc." 
- "DATAMARK, Inc."
- "Imagenet Llc"
- "Netsmartz Llc"
- "Quatrro Business Support Services" (with double r)
- "Remote CoWorker Inc." (no comma before Inc.)

I'll leave the file as is since the main content is correct; company names are readable. Only "Boldr, Inc." and "DATAMARK, Inc." have commas - in CSV those would be quoted. Let me fix those two so the CSV parses correctly.

The user wants me to do the same thing for this new list of accounts - look up the HQ city for each company and create a CSV with columns: Company, Profile URL, Website, Country, State, City. Some entries have no state (SupportNinja - United States with blank state). I'll need to look up each company's headquarters city.

Let me list the companies:
1. SupportNinja - United States, (no state)
2. SupportYourApp - United States, Delaware
3. SupportZebra - United States, Texas
4. The Functionary - United States, Texas
5. The Office Gurus - United States, Florida
6. Touchpoint Contact Centers Inc - United States, Ohio
7. Triniter BPO - United States, Florida
8. UnifyCX - United States, Kentucky
9. Unity Communications, LLC - United States, Arizona
10. Valor Global - United States, Arizona
11. Virtudesk - United States, Washington

I'll search for each company's HQ city.

- Unity Communications: Gilbert, Arizona (1530 E Williams Field Rd #201, Gilbert AZ - they say "Phoenix - Arizona" for Global HQ but address is Gilbert; Valor says Phoenix - I'll use Gilbert for Unity since that's the actual address)
- Valor Global: Phoenix, Arizona (13430 N Black Canyon Hwy / 3430 N Black Canyon Hwy, Phoenix AZ)
- Virtudesk: Bellevue, Washington (325 118th Ave SE, Bellevue WA)

Creating the CSV and appending to the existing file or creating a new one. User said "do the exact same for these other accounts" - so same format, same columns. I'll create a new CSV with just these 11 rows so they can merge or use as needed. Or append to the existing us-bpo-accounts-with-hq-city.csv? The user said "these other accounts too" which could mean add to the same file. I'll add these rows to the existing CSV file so everything is in one place.

I'll append the 11 new rows before the final empty line. SupportNinja had no state in the user's paste - I'll use Texas (Austin). Touchpoint Contact Centers Inc - need to quote if it has a comma? "Touchpoint Contact Centers Inc" - no comma. "Unity Communications, LLC" has a comma - need to quote.

Done. I added all 11 companies with their HQ cities. SupportNinja had no state in the user's list - I filled in Texas (Austin) from the research. Unity Communications has a comma in the name so I quoted it.

Summary of what was added:

**Added 11 rows** to `data/us-bpo-accounts-with-hq-city.csv` with the same columns (Company, Profile URL, Website, Country, State, City):

| Company | State | City |
|--------|--------|------|

| SupportZebra | Texas | Houston |
| The Functionary | Texas | Frisco |
| The Office Gurus | Florida | Seminole |

| Triniter BPO | Florida | Miami |
| UnifyCX | Kentucky | Louisville |
| Unity Communications, LLC | Arizona | Gilbert |
| Valor Global | Arizona | Phoenix |
| Virtudesk | Washington | Bellevue |

**Note:** SupportNinja had no state in your list; it’s recorded as **Texas** (Austin) from their HQ. The file now has 59 data rows plus the header (48 original + 11 new). Company names with commas (e.g. Unity Communications, LLC) are quoted in the CSV.
