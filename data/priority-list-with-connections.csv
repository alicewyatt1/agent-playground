NEARSOL’s public materials describe “AI” in a few concrete ways, mostly as enablement around CX delivery + recruiting, plus at least one security use case via a partner.

AI in recruiting: NEARSOL Intelligence Assistant (NIA)

NEARSOL says its recruitment process uses a “smart chatbot” to automate/standardize screening questions and “apply Artificial Intelligence” to applicant interactions to evaluate cultural fit for customer service work. They name this tool as the NEARSOL Intelligence Assistant (NIA).

AI in white-label delivery: AI-driven quality checks

AI in security/compliance: AI-powered continuous authentication (partner case study)

Valor does not prominently feature collections either. They do not advertise a standalone collections recovery service or third-party debt collection as part of their core BPO offerings on the main site. Only included in two scenarios:
1) The Utilities industry page on their site does include “Collections” under BPO services for utilities clients — which typically refers to account receivables follow-up for utility bills.
2) In their Billing & Revenue Cycle solutions section, Valor Global mentions collections and delinquency management as part of broader billing and revenue cycle work — again focused on in-industry account billing rather than external recovery.
