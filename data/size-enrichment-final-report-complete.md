| Account Management Systems | Mid Market (1,000-5,000) | <25 employees | **~100x overestimate** |
| Inspiro | Enterprise (5,000+) | 32,000-58,000 | ~6x underestimate |
| Conduent | Enterprise (5,000+) | 54,000-56,000 | ~10x underestimate |

## Recommendations

1. **Apply the 36 confirmed category changes** to the Master List
2. **Flag or remove** Convergys, Webhelp, and Sykes as acquired/merged entities
3. **Review presence of JPMorgan Chase and The Bosch Group** on list - these are not primarily BPO companies
4. **Add "Super Enterprise" category** to the size schema permanently (50,000+ employees)
5. **Prioritize data quality review** - Teleperformance classification error was critical
6. **Cross-reference** employee counts with LinkedIn, SEC filings, and company websites for accuracy
