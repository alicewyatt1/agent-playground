# US Mid-Market BPO — Messaging Playbook

> **For:** Calanthia's outreach to US mid-market BPOs
> **Use alongside:** US BPO Persona Map (ICP & persona reference)

---

## 1. Outreach Sequence

| Touch | Channel | Timing | Goal |
|-------|---------|--------|------|
| **1** | LinkedIn connection request | Day 1 | Get connected. No pitch. Be human. |
| **2** | LinkedIn message | Day 2–3 (after accept) | Build rapport. Plant event seed. Offer value. |
| **3** | Email | Day 5–7 | Persona-specific value prop. Ask for a call. |
| **4** | Email nudge | Day 12–14 | Proof point + lighter ask. |
| **5** | LinkedIn engage | Ongoing | Like / comment on their posts. Stay visible. |

---

## 2. LinkedIn — Connection Request

**Goal:** Get accepted. That's it. No pitch, no product, no cleverness. 300 character limit.

**Rule:** Every request should feel like it could only have been sent to this one person. If it could go to 50 people unchanged, rewrite it.

### Decision tree: which connection request to send

```
Do I have something SPECIFIC about this person?
(Recent post, shared connection, something notable about their company)
│
├─ YES → Use the PERSONAL request
│
└─ NO → Is there an upcoming event they might attend?
     │
     ├─ Southeast contact → CBAND Atlanta request
     ├─ Any US contact → Enterprise Connect request
     │
     └─ No event fits → Use the INDUSTRY PEER request
```

### Option A — Personal (best, use whenever possible)

> Hi [First Name] — [one specific thing about them]. Would love to connect.

Examples:

> Hi Mike — saw your post about attrition challenges in nearshore ops. That resonated. Would love to connect.

> Hi Sarah — congratulations on the Frost & Sullivan recognition for ResultsCX. Would love to connect.

> Hi James — I noticed you've been at Qualfon for over a decade. That kind of tenure in this industry is rare. Would love to connect.

### Option B — Event (when you don't have a personal hook)

**CBAND Atlanta:**

> Hi [First Name] — I'll be at the CCNG event in Atlanta on Feb 26. Would love to connect if you're in the area.

**Enterprise Connect:**

> Hi [First Name] — heading to Enterprise Connect next month. Would love to connect with fellow contact center leaders.

### Option C — Industry peer (fallback, no personal hook, no event)

> Hi [First Name] — I work with mid-market BPO leaders on AI strategy for voice operations. Would love to connect and compare notes.

---

## 3. LinkedIn — Follow-up Message (after they accept)

**Goal:** Build rapport. Offer something genuinely useful. Create a reason to talk — don't ask for anything yet.

**Rule:** Lead with *them*, not with you. The first sentence after "thanks for connecting" should be about something *they* did, said, or care about.

### Decision tree: which follow-up to send

```
Do I have an icebreaker?
(Something specific from their profile, posts, company news)
│
├─ YES ─── Is there an upcoming event?
│           │
│           ├─ YES → ICEBREAKER + EVENT message
│           └─ NO  → ICEBREAKER + VALUE OFFER message
│
└─ NO ──── Is there an upcoming event?
            │
            ├─ YES → COMPANY COMPLIMENT + EVENT message
            └─ NO  → COMPANY COMPLIMENT + VALUE OFFER message
```

### Template A — Icebreaker + Event (strongest)

> Thanks for connecting, [First Name].
>
> [ICEBREAKER — 1–2 sentences. Be specific. Reference a post, a milestone, something you noticed about their company. NOT a generic compliment.]
>
> I'll be at [EVENT] — are you planning to go? I've been spending time with BPO leaders exploring how AI is changing outbound operations and would love to compare notes in person.

**Example:**

> Thanks for connecting, Mike.
>
> I saw you've been at ACC Premier for over a decade — that kind of tenure in this industry says a lot about the culture you've built there.
>
> I'll be at the CCNG event in Atlanta on Feb 26 — any chance you're going? I've been talking to a lot of mid-market BPO leaders about what's actually working with AI in outbound, and I think you'd find the conversations interesting.

### Template B — Icebreaker + Value offer (no event)

> Thanks for connecting, [First Name].
>
> [ICEBREAKER — 1–2 sentences.]
>
> I've been having some really interesting conversations with BPO leaders about what's actually working with AI in voice operations — not the hype, the real results. Would be curious to hear how [Company] is thinking about it. Happy to share what I'm learning if that's useful.

### Template C — Company compliment + Event (no personal icebreaker)

> Thanks for connecting, [First Name].
>
> [Company] has a strong reputation in [their specialty — collections, customer service, etc.]. Impressive what you've built.
>
> I'll be at [EVENT] — are you planning to go? Would love to meet in person.

### Template D — Company compliment + Value offer (no icebreaker, no event)

> Thanks for connecting, [First Name].
>
> [Company] has a strong reputation in [their specialty]. I've been having some interesting conversations with BPO leaders about what's actually delivering results with AI in voice operations. Would be curious to hear how you're thinking about it — happy to share what I'm seeing if that's useful.

## 7. Do's and Don'ts

+---------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+
| **Do**                                | **Don't**                             |
+=======================================+=======================================+
| Lead with **AI autopilot**            | Don't say "copilot" or "agent         |
|                                       | assist" — we do full autopilot        |
+---------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+
| Mention both outbound and inbound,    | Don't lead with product features      |
| emphasise outbound                    | or a demo offer                       |
+---------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+
| Talk margin and EBITDA directly       | Don't send the same message to        |
| with COO/CFO                          | all three personas                    |
+---------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+
| Reference Teleperformance early       | Don't use "early access" framing      |
| for credibility                       | (PH positioning, not for US)          |
+---------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+
| Use events as conversation starters   | Don't position as a startup           |
+---------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+
| Personalise every message             | Don't batch-send identical emails     |
+---------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+
| Position Calanthia as a senior        | Don't use "APO Labs" — we are         |
| industry expert, not a salesperson    | **Dyna.ai** in the US market          |
+---------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+
| Keep first-touch emails under         | Don't shy away from talking about     |
| 150 words                             | replacing manual volume — C-suite     |
|                                       | cares about margin, not headcount     |

### How Calanthia should use this

1. **Before writing an email:** Check what industries the target BPO serves.
2. **Pick 1–2 case studies** that match their client industries or use cases (collections, telesales, inbound).
3. **Check the "Can name?" column.** If unconfirmed, use the generic label in the email. Save the real name for a live call.
4. **Grab the metrics** from the "Key metrics" column and drop them into the proof-points section of the email template.
5. **If their industry isn't listed:** Default to the Teleperformance / Sands story (enterprise credibility) or the Digital Bank Singapore story (pilot-to-scale in regulated environment). These are the most universally resonant.
