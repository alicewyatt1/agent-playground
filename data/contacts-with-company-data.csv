They do offer finance & accounting outsourcing that includes accounts receivable / invoicing (i.e., getting paid on customer invoices), and they discuss improving “collections” in that context.

NEARSOL says its recruitment process uses a “smart chatbot” to automate/standardize screening questions and “apply Artificial Intelligence” to applicant interactions to evaluate cultural fit for customer service work. They name this tool as the NEARSOL Intelligence Assistant (NIA).

AI in white-label delivery: AI-driven quality checks

In NEARSOL’s white-label BPO thought leadership, they explicitly reference “AI-driven quality checks” as part of how they scale white-label programs (paired with “cultural training tailored by market”). They don’t provide implementation details (vendor/model/workflow), but they do claim AI is used in QA/quality checking.

AI in security/compliance: AI-powered continuous authentication (partner case study)
