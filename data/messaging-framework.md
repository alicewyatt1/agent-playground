---

## 1. ICP — Company Targeting

### Primary Segment: US Mid-Market Contact Center / BPO

| Criteria | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Employee count** | 1,000–5,000 globally |
| **HQ / Presence** | US HQ or meaningful US presence (onshore center, US-based C-suite) |
| **Service lines** | Contact center with outbound capabilities (telemarketing, collections, or both) |
| **Tech posture** | Open to AI / automation; not locked into legacy-only approach |
| **Delivery footprint** | Ideally multi-geo (onshore + nearshore/offshore) — indicates operational sophistication |

### Buying Signals (indicators of readiness)
- Recently won a large client contract and needs to scale outbound capacity
- Public statements about AI strategy or digital transformation
- Speaking at / sponsoring industry events (Enterprise Connect, CCW, etc.)
- Hiring for innovation, AI, or digital roles
- Active on LinkedIn discussing industry trends

### Red Flags (reasons to deprioritize)
- Captive BPO (serves only parent company)
- Financial distress or recent major layoffs
- Pure IT-BPM without contact center operations
- No outbound service lines whatsoever

---

## 2. Three Personas

### Persona 1: Executive Sponsor

**Titles:** CEO, Founder, Owner, Chairman, President, Co-Founder & CEO, Managing Partner

**Role in deal:** Economic buyer. Final budget authority. Signs off on strategic partnerships.

**What they care about:**
- Competitive survival in an AI-disrupted market
- Revenue growth and new revenue streams
- Market positioning — being seen as innovative, not left behind
- Client retention — meeting enterprise clients' growing AI expectations
- Margin protection as labor costs rise

**Their success metrics:**
- Revenue growth, EBITDA
- New client acquisition / client retention rate
- Market positioning and brand perception
- Shareholder / board confidence

**Core message to them:**

> AI is reshaping the BPO industry. The leaders who move now will capture the next wave of growth. We help you add a new AI-powered outbound revenue stream — scaling infinitely without proportional headcount — while paying only for results delivered.

**Pain points (ranked by urgency):**
1. **HIGH:** Enterprise clients asking "what's your AI strategy?" and not having a compelling answer
2. **HIGH:** Watching competitors announce AI initiatives while standing still
3. **MEDIUM:** Margin compression from rising labor costs with no scalability lever
4. **MEDIUM:** Turning down outbound business because capacity can't scale fast enough

**Objections and responses:**

| Objection | Response |
|---|---|
| "We're not ready for AI yet" | "That's exactly why a focused outbound pilot makes sense. It's low-risk, high-visibility, and gives you a real AI story to tell clients and the board." |
| "What makes you different from other AI vendors?" | "We're not a SaaS vendor selling you tools. We bring deep operational expertise — we design the scripts, segment the workflows, and optimize outcomes. We've done this at enterprise scale with Teleperformance and major telecoms." |
| "Our clients won't accept AI on their calls" | "Our agents are human-like and multilingual. In production, clients often can't tell the difference. And the outcome-based pricing means you only pay when it works." |

**Case studies to use:**
- Teleperformance / Sands Macau — enterprise BPO credibility, hotel booking confirmation
- Digital Bank Singapore — 76% promise-to-pay, full compliance (PDPA & MAS)
- IZZI / Megacable telecom campaigns — 10K+ daily volume, proven at scale

---

### Persona 2: Operations Leader

**Titles:** COO, VP Operations, SVP Operations, VP Client Services, SVP Client Services, VP of Business Operations, EVP Operations, VP Client Solutions, Regional VP

**Role in deal:** Champion. Drives the evaluation process. Owns the operational outcome.

**What they care about:**
- Hitting conversion targets and SLAs
- Scaling outbound capacity without linear headcount growth
- Operational efficiency and cost-per-contact
- Agent utilization and workforce management
- Delivering results for their end clients

**Their success metrics:**
- Conversion rate, promise-to-pay rate
- Cost per contact / cost per acquisition
- Daily outbound volume and reach rate
- SLA adherence
- Client satisfaction scores

**Core message to them:**

> Your outbound team has 10 people making calls. What if you could deploy 10,000 AI agents alongside them — running 24/7, in multiple languages, hitting targets that manual teams can't reach? We bring the operational expertise to make it work: script design, workflow segmentation, and continuous optimization. You pay for outcomes, not seats.

**Pain points (ranked by urgency):**
1. **HIGH:** Can't scale outbound volume fast enough to meet client targets
2. **HIGH:** Low reach rates and high cost-per-contact on manual outbound campaigns
3. **MEDIUM:** Inconsistent quality across agents (especially during turnover)
4. **MEDIUM:** Clients requesting AI-enhanced delivery and no solution to offer

**Objections and responses:**

| Objection | Response |
|---|---|
| "Quality won't match our agents" | "In our deployments, AI agents achieve 99% tagging accuracy and 76% promise-to-pay rates. The key is our operational approach — we don't just plug in tech, we design scripts and segment workflows based on deep domain expertise." |
| "Implementation sounds complex" | "We typically deliver an MVP in 1 week and a full pilot in 30 days. Our Agent Studio is low-code with version control and one-click rollback. Your team doesn't need to be technical." |
| "My clients won't accept this" | "Start with use cases where AI is clearly additive — booking confirmations, payment reminders, lead qualification. These expand your capacity without touching existing agent workflows. Once clients see the results, the conversation changes." |

**Case studies to use:**
- IZZI (Mexican telco) — 20K records processed, 136 effective sales, 4.7% conversion rate
- Megacable — 10K+ daily outbound volume, 99% tagging accuracy, dual-agent workflow
- Viraal (Mexican fintech) — Collections segmented by DPD bucket with tone-adapted scripts, 25% responder rate
- Digital Bank Singapore — 2-3K daily volume, 76% promise-to-pay, 40% reach rate
- E-commerce Philippines — 10% sales activation, 5/6 labor saving

---

### Persona 3: Technology Leader

**Titles:** CTO, CIO, VP Technology, VP Engineering, VP Software Engineering, CISO, VP IT, VP Digital Innovation

**Role in deal:** Technical gatekeeper. Blocks or approves based on feasibility, security, and integration.

**What they care about:**
- Integration with existing infrastructure (dialers, CRM, telephony)
- Security, data privacy, and compliance
- System reliability and uptime
- Deployment flexibility (cloud vs. on-prem)
- Build vs. buy — can we do this ourselves?

**Their success metrics:**
- Integration time and deployment speed
- Uptime and system reliability
- Security incidents (zero tolerance)
- Total cost of ownership

**Core message to them:**

> Our platform is built for enterprise contact center operations — not a demo stitched together from open-source APIs. Agent Studio gives you low-code configuration, version control, one-click rollback, and continuous monitoring. Deploy on cloud, on-prem, or hybrid. We run at 95%+ uptime with built-in compliance controls, content guardrails, and full audit trails.

**Pain points (ranked by urgency):**
1. **HIGH:** Pressure from leadership to "do something with AI" without a reliable platform to deploy
2. **MEDIUM:** Concerns about voice AI quality, latency, and hallucination risk in production
3. **MEDIUM:** Compliance requirements for outbound calling (state-by-state regulations)
4. **LOW:** Build-vs-buy evaluation fatigue — too many vendors, unclear differentiation

**Objections and responses:**

| Objection | Response |
|---|---|
| "We can build this ourselves" | "You can get 60-80% there by gluing together ElevenLabs and a dialer. The last 20% — production-grade uptime, script optimization, compliance controls, multi-language routing — is where deployments fail. That's our core expertise." |
| "Security and compliance concerns" | "We offer on-prem and hybrid deployment. Data encryption at rest and in transit. Centralized identity and permission management. We're already compliant with PDPA and MAS guidelines in regulated markets. For US outbound, we work with you on state-by-state compliance setup." |
| "What's the integration effort?" | "Our platform integrates via SIP for telephony and API for CRM/ATS systems. We've integrated with Cisco, Moka, and custom platforms. Typical integration: 1-2 weeks for a pilot." |

**Case studies to use:**
- Technical Highlights deck — Agent Studio, inference engine (P99 latency 10x reduction, 30% utilization improvement)
- HSBC Copilot POC — 98.6% factualness vs. 67.5% for competitor, 88.1% helpfulness
- Digital Bank journey — from pilot to multi-product expansion over 12 months
- Saudi Arabia telco — local cloud deployment, local language support, Cisco integration

## 3. Core Positioning

### Lead Narrative (use across all personas)

> **AI is no longer software. It's becoming a workforce.**
>
> In 2026, the BPOs that win aren't just using AI as a tool — they're deploying AI workers alongside human teams. Workers that show up with KPIs, get measured on results, and scale infinitely.

### Value Proposition (outbound-specific)

> **Dyna.ai deploys AI voice agents that run your outbound operations at scale — telemarketing, collections, renewals, confirmations — with human-like conversations in 10+ languages. You pay for outcomes, not seats.**

### Positioning Statement

> For mid-market BPOs with outbound operations, Dyna.ai is the AI workforce partner that delivers measurable business results — not just technology. Unlike vendors who sell tools, we bring deep operational expertise and outcome-aligned pricing to every deployment. We've proven this at enterprise scale with Teleperformance, major telecoms, and digital banks across three continents.

### Key Phrases to Use

| Phrase | When to Use |
|---|---|
| "AI Workforce" | Always. Replace "AI agents," "bots," or "tools" with this. |
| "Results as a Service" | When discussing pricing or business model. |
| "Outbound autopilot" | When describing the product simply. |
| "Expand your outbound engine without adding headcount" | Core hook for Operations leaders. |
| "We work with industry leaders like Teleperformance" | Credibility in any context. |
| "Outcome-aligned pricing" | When they ask about cost / pricing model. |
| "Production-grade" | When differentiating from DIY or startup competitors. |

### Key Phrases to Avoid

| Avoid | Why | Use Instead |
|---|---|---|
| "Replace your agents" | Threatening, triggers resistance | "Scale alongside your team" |
| "Robo-calls" / "Bots" | Sounds cheap, low-quality | "AI voice agents" / "AI workforce" |
| "Cost cutting" | Wrong frame for outbound (outbound is revenue) | "Revenue expansion" / "Hit targets" |
| "We're a startup" | Undermines credibility | "We've deployed at enterprise scale" |
| "Our technology" | Too tech-focused | "Our operational expertise" |
| "SaaS platform" | Old model | "AI workforce partner" |

---

## 4. Key Differentiators

### Why Dyna vs. Competitors

**1. Operational Expertise (Primary Differentiator)**
We don't just deploy technology — we design the call scripts, segment the workflows (e.g., DPD 30/60/90 day collection strategies with tone-adapted agents), and continuously optimize outcomes. Our team comes from BPO operations, not just software engineering.

**2. Production-Grade Reliability**
Competitors gluing together open-source stacks (ElevenLabs + dialer + basic prompting) typically reach 60-80% quality. Our purpose-built platform delivers 95%+ uptime with enterprise-grade monitoring, failover, and continuous agent optimization.

**3. Enterprise-Scale Track Record**
We run AI agents in production for Teleperformance, major telecoms (Saudi Arabia, Thailand, Mexico), digital banks, and insurance companies. 200K+ outbound calls per month in some deployments.

**4. Outcome-Aligned Pricing**
We offer task-based, role-based, or performance-based pricing. Clients can pay per call, per outcome, or through revenue sharing. This aligns our incentives and removes the risk for buyers.

**5. Multi-Language at Scale**
10+ languages in production today including English, Spanish, Arabic, Thai, Singlish, Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese, Indonesian, and more. Multi-agent orchestration with automatic language detection and routing.

### Competitive Positioning

| Competitor Type | Their Pitch | Our Counter |
|---|---|---|
| **DIY (BPO builds internally)** | "We can do this ourselves with ElevenLabs + a dialer" | "You'll get to 80%. The last 20% — uptime, script optimization, compliance, multi-language — is where it fails. We've already solved that." |
| **CCaaS adding AI features** (NICE, Five9, Genesys) | "We're adding AI to your existing platform" | "They're adding features to a legacy platform. We're purpose-built for AI-first operations. Different architecture, different outcomes." |
| **Pure AI voice vendors** (Vapi, PolyAI) | "We have the best voice tech" | "Voice quality is table stakes. The difference is operational expertise — knowing how to design scripts, segment audiences, and optimize for real business outcomes. We run full outbound operations, not just tech." |

---

### Touch 1: LinkedIn Connection Request

**Goal:** Get accepted. That's it. No pitch. No product. Just be human.

**Character limit:** 300 characters (LinkedIn limit with note).

#### If they might attend Enterprise Connect (default for all US):
> Hi [First Name] — heading to Enterprise Connect in Vegas next month. Great to meet fellow contact center leaders. Would love to connect!

#### If they're in the Southeast / CBAND Atlanta:
> Hi [First Name] — I'll be at the CCNG event in Atlanta on Feb 26. Would love to connect if you're in the area!

#### If neither event applies (fallback):
> Hi [First Name] — I spend my days working with BPO leaders on AI strategy for outbound ops. Would love to connect and compare notes.

---

### Touch 2: LinkedIn Message (after they accept)

**Goal:** Build rapport. Reference something personal. Plant the event seed. Offer value, not a pitch.

**Length:** 3-5 sentences. Conversational.

#### Template:

> Thanks for connecting, [First Name]!
>
> [ICEBREAKER — 1-2 sentences. Use the Icebreaker Insight column, or reference something from their profile/company. Be specific and genuine.]
>
> I've been spending a lot of time with mid-market BPO leaders exploring how AI voice agents are transforming outbound operations. Fascinating space right now.
>
> [EVENT HOOK — choose one:]
> - Are you planning to be at Enterprise Connect next month? Would be great to meet in person.
> - I'll be at the CCNG event in Atlanta on the 26th — would love to grab coffee if you're nearby.
> - Would love to share some of what I'm learning if you're ever up for a quick call.

#### Example (Operations Leader, Southeast):

> Thanks for connecting, Mike!
>
> I noticed you've been at ACC Premier for over a decade — that kind of tenure in this industry says a lot. Impressive.
>
> I've been working with contact center ops leaders on something I think you'd find interesting — AI voice agents that handle outbound campaigns at scale. Seeing some really compelling results.
>
> I'll be at the CCNG event in Atlanta on Feb 26 — any chance you're in the area? Would love to compare notes.

---

### Touch 3: Email — Persona-Specific

**Goal:** Deliver the core value proposition tailored to their role. Ask for a call.

**Length:** 6-8 sentences. Clear, direct, no fluff.

---

#### Email Template: Executive Sponsor

**Subject lines** (choose one):
- AI + outbound at [Company]
- How [Company] could 10x outbound without headcount
- A different approach to AI for BPOs

> Hi [First Name],
>
> [ICEBREAKER or reference LinkedIn connection: "Great connecting on LinkedIn" / "I noticed [Company] was recognized as one of the top outsourcing providers this year — well deserved."]
>
> I'll keep this brief. The BPOs that are getting ahead in 2026 aren't just cutting costs with AI — they're building entirely new outbound revenue streams with it.
>
> We deploy AI voice agents that run telemarketing, collections, and customer activation campaigns at 10x the volume of human teams — with conversion rates that match or beat manual outreach. Unlike vendors selling tools, we bring deep operational expertise and align our pricing to your outcomes. You pay for results, not seats.
>
> We've done this at enterprise scale with operators like Teleperformance and major telecoms across three continents. Happy to share what we're learning.
>
> Would you be open to a 20-minute call?
>
> Best,
> Calanthia

---

#### Email Template: Operations Leader

**Subject lines** (choose one):
- Scaling outbound without scaling headcount
- 10K outbound calls/day — without adding agents
- Your outbound capacity, uncapped

> Hi [First Name],
>
> [ICEBREAKER or reference LinkedIn connection]
>
> I work with contact center ops leaders who need to hit outbound targets without proportional headcount growth. If that sounds familiar, I think you'll find this interesting.
>
> We deploy AI voice agents that handle outbound campaigns end-to-end — telemarketing, collections, payment reminders, booking confirmations. These aren't robo-dialers. They're human-like, multilingual agents that detect intent in real time, adapt their script, and tag outcomes automatically.
>
> A few recent results:
> - 10K+ daily outbound calls with 99% tagging accuracy (major telco)
> - 76% promise-to-pay rate on credit card collections (digital bank)
> - 4.7% conversion rate on telesales upsell campaign (telecom, 20K records)
>
> The difference: we don't just plug in tech. We design scripts, segment workflows (e.g., DPD 30/60/90 with tone-adapted agents), and optimize continuously based on your outcomes.
>
> Would a 20-minute call make sense to see if this fits [Company]?
>
> Best,
> Calanthia

---

#### Email Template: Technology Leader

**Subject lines** (choose one):
- Production-grade voice AI for outbound
- Enterprise AI agents — not another demo
- The 60-80% problem in voice AI

> Hi [First Name],
>
> [ICEBREAKER or reference LinkedIn connection]
>
> I lead the US expansion for Dyna.ai — we build production-grade AI voice agents for contact center operations. I wanted to reach out because our approach to deployment might interest you.
>
> Most teams that try to build outbound AI internally — gluing together ElevenLabs, a dialer, and some prompting — get to about 60-80% quality. The last 20% (uptime, multi-language routing, script optimization, compliance controls) is where deployments fail in production.
>
> That's what we've solved. Our platform, Agent Studio, is purpose-built:
> - Flexible deployment: cloud, on-prem, or hybrid
> - 95%+ uptime with automatic failover
> - Low-code agent config with version control and one-click rollback
> - 10+ languages in production with automatic detection and routing
> - Built-in compliance controls, content guardrails, full audit trails
>
> We run voice agents at scale for Teleperformance, major telecoms, and digital banks across three continents.
>
> I'd value your perspective on what matters most for [Company]. Would you be open to a technical conversation?
>
> Best,
> Calanthia

---

### Touch 4: Email Nudge (if no reply)

**Goal:** Lighter touch. Lead with a proof point. Create curiosity.

**Subject:** Re: [original subject]

> Hi [First Name],
>
> Quick follow-up — thought this might be interesting context.
>
> [INSERT ONE RELEVANT PROOF POINT — choose based on persona and company:]
>
> **For Executive:** "One of the enterprise BPOs we work with went from a single collections pilot to deploying AI voice agents across three product lines in under 12 months. The conversation started exactly like this one."
>
> **For Operations:** "We recently helped a telecom run a 20,000-record upsell campaign with a dual-agent model (promotion agent + validation agent). 136 closed sales — fully automated, no human intervention during the call."
>
> **For Technology:** "Our inference engine reduced P99 latency by 10x and increased throughput by 3x compared to standard deployments. Happy to share the technical architecture if you're evaluating options."
>
> No pressure — just thought it might be useful. Happy to chat whenever timing works.
>
> Best,
> Calanthia

### When to Reference Teleperformance

Teleperformance is the biggest name we can drop. Use it:
- In the first email to Executive Sponsors (establishes enterprise credibility)
- When a prospect says "have you worked with anyone like us?"
- When they question whether AI can work at BPO scale
- **Note:** We can use the Teleperformance name and logo per contractual permission

## 9. Objection Handling Quick Reference

| Objection | Type | Response Framework |
|---|---|---|
| "We're already doing AI" | Deflection | "That's great — most BPOs we talk to have started with internal tools or copilots. Where we see the biggest gap is in outbound production. Are you running AI agents on live outbound campaigns today?" |
| "We're not ready for AI" | Timing | "That's actually the best time to start a pilot. A focused outbound deployment takes 30 days and gives you real data to build your AI strategy around — not theory." |
| "Send me some information" | Soft no | "Of course. But the most valuable thing I can share is what we're learning from deployments with operators like yours. Can we do 15 minutes so I can tailor what I send?" |
| "We tried AI and it didn't work" | Past failure | "That's more common than you'd think. Most pilots fail because of execution, not technology. Our approach is operationally led — we design the scripts and workflows, not just plug in tech. What did you try before?" |
| "We build our own tech" | DIY | "We see a lot of that. Teams usually get to 60-80% quality. The last 20% — uptime, compliance, multi-language, continuous optimization — is where it breaks in production. Happy to show you where the gap typically is." |
| "What's it cost?" | Premature pricing | "It depends on the use case and volume. We offer outcome-aligned pricing — you can pay per call, per successful outcome, or through revenue sharing. The point is you don't pay unless it works." |

## Appendix A: Industry Context for Conversations

### Talking Points About the Market

Use these when establishing credibility in conversations. Don't recite them — weave them naturally.

- **"Nearly 53% of contact centers with outbound capabilities already do telemarketing."** This isn't a niche offering — it's where the industry already operates. AI just removes the scaling constraint.

- **"The US controls global BPO distribution."** 83.7% of your priority accounts are US-HQ'd. Decisions are made here. AI adoption will be driven from here.

- **"Small and mid-market BPOs serve enterprise clients."** 92.7% of mid-market BPOs (1K-5K employees) report enterprise client relationships. These are sophisticated operators, not call shops.

- **"Outbound is directly linked to conversion targets."** Unlike inbound (which is about CSAT and cost), outbound speaks the language of revenue, targets, and metrics. This makes the ROI case much cleaner.

- **"AI agents get performance reviews now."** This line (from the Narrative Workshop) is sticky and memorable. Use it when people ask "but how do you ensure quality?" The answer: the same way you manage human agents — KPIs, monitoring, continuous optimization.

### Conference Agenda Keywords (for credibility in conversations)

These topics dominate the 2026 US contact center conference circuit. Using them signals that you're plugged into the industry:

- AI acceleration — from pilot to pervasive
- The economics of AI to improve CX while reducing costs
- Where are the humans in the contact center of the future?
- Micro wins vs. moonshots in AI deployment
- Journey orchestration beyond the contact center
- Build vs. buy in AI strategy
- Integrations replacing monolithic systems

## Appendix B: Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Lead with **AI transformation** narrative, then pivot to **outbound specifically**
- Frame outbound AI as **revenue expansion** (positive), not cost cutting (negative)
- Reference **working with industry leaders like Teleperformance** early
- Use **events as conversation starters** — human, not salesy
- Personalize every message — use the **Icebreaker Insight column** from the contact list
- Position Calanthia as a **senior industry expert**, not a salesperson
- Mention **outcome-aligned pricing** — removes risk for the buyer
- Keep LinkedIn messages **short and conversational**
- Keep emails **under 150 words** for the first touch

### Don't
- Don't lead with product features or a demo offer
- Don't send the same message to all three personas
- Don't use "early access" framing (this was PH positioning — doesn't work for US)
- Don't position as "Silicon Valley startup" (US BPO leaders are skeptical of tech vendors)
- Don't mention compliance as a selling point yet (still being set up for US)
- Don't batch-send identical emails through HubSpot for the first cohort (personalize each one)
- Don't pitch inbound AI or the full platform — stay focused on **outbound**
- Don't use the term "APO Labs" — we are **Dyna.ai** in the US market
