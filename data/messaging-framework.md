## 1. ICP — Company Targeting

### Primary Segment: US Mid-Market Contact Center / BPO

| Criteria | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Employee count** | 1,000–5,000 globally |
| **HQ / Presence** | US HQ or meaningful US presence (onshore center, US-based C-suite) |
| **Service lines** | Contact center operations (outbound preferred, but inbound-heavy also qualifies) |
| **Tech posture** | Open to AI / automation; not locked into legacy-only approach |
| **Delivery footprint** | Ideally multi-geo (onshore + nearshore/offshore) — indicates operational sophistication |

### Buying Signals (indicators of readiness)
- Recently won a large client contract and needs to scale outbound capacity
- Public statements about AI strategy or digital transformation
- Speaking at / sponsoring industry events (Enterprise Connect, CCW, etc.)
- Hiring for innovation, AI, or digital roles
- Active on LinkedIn discussing industry trends

### Red Flags (reasons to deprioritize)
- Captive BPO (serves only parent company)
- Financial distress or recent major layoffs
- Pure IT-BPM without contact center operations

### Why Mid-Market Is the Right Entry Point (GLG Expert Validation)

An industry expert with 35 years of experience (former executive at Sitel/Synnex, Transcom) confirmed:

- **The ~$80B US contact center market** is growing at 2-5% per year
- **Mid-market BPOs are the most vulnerable** to AI disruption: they lack the capital to build their own AI (unlike Teleperformance, which committed $185M to internal AI), but their clients are actively demanding AI-enhanced delivery and writing 20% cost reductions into contracts over the next 3 years
- **Mid-market operators NEED external AI partners** — this is our entry point
- **Revenue per seat per year:** US onshore ~$40-50K | Nearshore ~$25-30K | Offshore ~$18-25K
- **EBITDA margins by geography:** US onshore 5-8% | Nearshore 20-30% | Offshore 40-55%
- **AI autopilot can fundamentally reshape these economics** — one AI-first digital services company is running at 40% EBITDA margins with 40% annual growth, using per-outcome pricing

These economics are powerful ammunition in conversations with CFOs and COOs.

## 2. Three Personas

### Persona 1: Executive Sponsor

**Titles:** CEO, Founder, Owner, Chairman, President, Co-Founder & CEO, Managing Partner

**Role in deal:** Economic buyer. Final budget authority. Signs off on strategic partnerships.

**What they care about:**
- Competitive survival — clients are writing AI-driven cost reductions into contracts
- Revenue growth and new revenue streams through AI-powered delivery
- Market positioning — being seen as AI-forward, not left behind
- Client retention — enterprise clients are demanding AI or threatening to go direct to AI vendors
- EBITDA expansion — AI autopilot can transform their margin structure

**Their success metrics:**
- Revenue growth, EBITDA margin
- New client acquisition / client retention rate
- AI strategy credibility with clients and board
- Shareholder / board confidence

**Core message to them:**

> Your clients are increasingly expecting AI-enhanced delivery — and some are building cost reduction targets directly into contracts. The BPOs that deliver AI autopilot — not just copilots or tools, but full autonomous execution — will win those renewals and capture the next wave of growth. We deploy AI autopilot for outbound and inbound operations, scaling infinitely without headcount. You pay for outcomes, not seats.

**Pain points (ranked by urgency):**
1. **HIGH:** Clients demanding AI-enhanced delivery and threatening to buy AI directly, bypassing the BPO entirely
2. **HIGH:** Watching competitors announce AI initiatives while standing still — can't afford to be last
3. **HIGH:** Margin compression with no scalability lever (US onshore EBITDA at 5-8% is unsustainable)
4. **MEDIUM:** Turning down business because capacity can't scale fast enough

**Objections and responses:**

| Objection | Response |
|---|---|
| "We're not ready for AI yet" | "That's exactly why a focused outbound pilot makes sense. It's low-risk, high-visibility, and gives you a real AI story to tell clients and the board." |
| "What makes you different from other AI vendors?" | "We're not a SaaS vendor selling you tools. We bring deep operational expertise — we design the scripts, segment the workflows, and optimize outcomes. We've done this at enterprise scale with Teleperformance and major telecoms." |
| "Our clients won't accept AI on their calls" | "Our agents are human-like and multilingual. In production, clients often can't tell the difference. And the outcome-based pricing means you only pay when it works." |

**Case studies to use:**
- Teleperformance / Sands Macau — enterprise BPO credibility, hotel booking confirmation
- Digital Bank Singapore — 76% promise-to-pay, full compliance (PDPA & MAS)
- IZZI / Megacable telecom campaigns — 10K+ daily volume, proven at scale

### Persona 2: Operations Leader (+ Finance)

**Titles:** COO, CFO, VP Operations, SVP Operations, VP Client Services, SVP Client Services, VP of Business Operations, EVP Operations, VP Client Solutions, VP Finance, Regional VP

**Role in deal:** COO = Champion who drives evaluation and owns operational outcome. CFO = Margin holder who validates the business case and approves spend.

**What they care about:**
- **Service quality** — Hitting client SLAs and conversion targets
- **Protecting EBITDA** — High margin pressure from labour costs, and scaling revenue is dependent on scaling headcount
- **Staffing correctly** — Overstaffing kills margin, understaffing kills SLAs; constant challenge given high annual attrition (20-30%+ is typical in the industry)
- **Forecast accuracy** — Aligning workforce planning with unpredictable call / outbound volumes
- **Avoiding operational disruption** — Ensuring any new innovation must not jeopardize existing SLAs or client relationships

**Their success metrics:**
- EBITDA margin (by site, by client, by program)
- Conversion rate (outbound), resolution rate
- Revenue per seat per year
- Daily volume capacity and utilisation rate
- SLA adherence and client contract renewal rate

**Core message to them:**

> AI autopilot gives you capacity that doesn't churn, doesn't need ramping and meets SLAs. We deploy fully autonomous agents for outbound and inbound that run 24/7 in multiple languages alongside your existing team. You keep staffing lean, protect your margin and scale on demand without the hiring gamble. Your costs flex with your client's demand.

**Pain points (ranked by urgency):**
1. **HIGH:** Agent attrition bleeding money — ~37% annual turnover, $10-35K per replacement, constant cycle of hiring and retraining that never ends
2. **HIGH:** Can't scale capacity fast enough — demand spikes and new client wins require headcount they can't add quickly enough, leading to missed SLAs and lost business
3. **HIGH:** Margin pressure from labor costs — labor is ~2/3 of the budget, and onshore delivery in particular runs at razor-thin EBITDA (5-8%)
4. **MEDIUM:** Quality inconsistency — new agents underperform, manual QA only covers 1-3% of calls, and distributed teams are hard to monitor consistently
5. **MEDIUM:** Clients asking about automation capabilities — not universal yet at mid-market, but increasingly part of RFPs and contract renewals
6. **MEDIUM:** Competitors who adopt AI early will undercut on price and win on delivery speed

**Objections and responses:**

| Objection | Response |
|---|---|
| "Quality won't match our agents" | "In our deployments, AI agents achieve 99% tagging accuracy and 76% promise-to-pay rates. The key is our operational approach — we don't just plug in tech, we design scripts and segment workflows based on deep domain expertise." |
| "Implementation sounds complex" | "We typically deliver an MVP in 1 week and a full pilot in 30 days. Our Agent Studio is low-code with version control and one-click rollback. Your team doesn't need to be technical." |
| "My clients won't accept this" | "Start with use cases where AI is clearly additive — booking confirmations, payment reminders, lead qualification. These expand your capacity without touching existing agent workflows. Once clients see the results, the conversation changes." |
| "What's the ROI?" | "Let's do the math together. You're paying $40-50K/seat/year onshore. Our AI autopilot runs at a fraction of that, with per-outcome pricing — you only pay when a call achieves its objective. One of our clients went from 10% to 40% EBITDA on AI-handled volume." |
| "How does pricing work?" | "Three options: per-task (per call), per-role (benchmarked to human labor cost), or per-outcome (revenue/profit sharing). We align to what makes your P&L work. The point is you're not buying software — you're buying results." |
| "We can't afford a big AI investment right now" | "That's exactly the point. This isn't a capital investment. It's an operating expense that only kicks in when it delivers. No upfront platform fees. No multi-year commitment. Start with a 30-day pilot on one campaign and measure the margin impact directly." |

**Case studies to use:**
- IZZI (Mexican telco) — 20K records processed, 136 effective sales, 4.7% conversion rate
- Megacable — 10K+ daily outbound volume, 99% tagging accuracy, dual-agent workflow
- Viraal (Mexican fintech) — Collections segmented by DPD bucket with tone-adapted scripts, 25% responder rate
- Digital Bank Singapore — 2-3K daily volume, 76% promise-to-pay, 40% reach rate, outcome-based collections
- E-commerce Philippines — 10% sales activation, 5/6 labor saving
- Airline Saudi Arabia — 85%+ booking success rate, 4K+ daily, 40% labor cost reduction
- Klarna example (industry context) — eliminated 700 agent positions, saved $40M/year (use as market context, not Dyna case)

### Persona 3: Technology Leader

**Titles:** CTO, CIO, VP Technology, VP Engineering, VP Software Engineering, CISO, VP IT, VP Digital Innovation

**Role in deal:** Technical gatekeeper. Blocks or approves based on feasibility, security, and integration.

**What they care about:**
- **Security, data privacy, and compliance** — One breach and the company is done. PCI-DSS, HIPAA (depending on clients), state-level regulations. This consumes a large share of their bandwidth.
- **System reliability and uptime** — If the phones go down, nothing else matters. Keeping a multi-site, multi-channel operation running is the baseline expectation.
- **Integration with existing stack** — They're running Genesys, Amazon Connect, Zendesk, or similar. Anything new must work with what they have, not replace it.
- **Total cost of ownership** — Limited budget, small team, expected to deliver innovation. They can't build like Teleperformance.

**Their success metrics:**
- Integration time and deployment speed
- Uptime and system reliability
- Security incidents (zero tolerance)
- Number of vendor integrations maintained

**Core message to them:**

> Our platform is enterprise-ready — used by the largest contact centers including Teleperformance. Deploy on cloud, on-prem, or hybrid. We run at 95%+ uptime with built-in compliance controls, content guardrails, and full audit trails. Deployments are API-first — integrates via SIP for telephony and API for CRM (Genesys, Cisco, Zendesk, and custom platforms). Secure by design, minimal internal engineering lift.

**Pain points (ranked by urgency):**
1. **HIGH:** Pressure from leadership to "do something with AI" without a reliable platform to deploy
2. **MEDIUM:** Concerns about voice AI quality, latency, and hallucination risk in production
3. **MEDIUM:** Compliance requirements for outbound calling (state-by-state regulations)
4. **LOW:** Build-vs-buy evaluation fatigue — too many vendors, unclear differentiation

**Objections and responses:**

| Objection | Response |
|---|---|
| "We can build this ourselves" | "You can get 60-80% there by gluing together ElevenLabs and a dialer. The last 20% — production-grade uptime, script optimization, compliance controls, multi-language routing — is where deployments fail. That's our core expertise." |
| "Security and compliance concerns" | "We offer on-prem and hybrid deployment. Data encryption at rest and in transit. Centralized identity and permission management. We're already compliant with PDPA and MAS guidelines in regulated markets. For US outbound, we work with you on state-by-state compliance setup." |
| "What's the integration effort?" | "Our platform integrates via SIP for telephony and API for CRM/ATS systems. We've integrated with Cisco, Moka, and custom platforms. Typical integration: 1-2 weeks for a pilot." |

**Case studies to use:**
- Technical Highlights deck — Agent Studio, inference engine (P99 latency 10x reduction, 30% utilization improvement)
- HSBC Copilot POC — 98.6% factualness vs. 67.5% for competitor, 88.1% helpfulness
- Digital Bank journey — from pilot to multi-product expansion over 12 months
- Saudi Arabia telco — local cloud deployment, local language support, Cisco integration

## 3. Core Positioning

### Lead Narrative (use across all personas)

> **AI is no longer software. It's becoming a workforce.**
>
> In 2026, the BPOs that win aren't just using AI as a copilot — they're deploying full AI autopilot. Not tools that assist agents. Autonomous AI workers that handle entire calls, entire campaigns, entire workflows — and get measured on results.

### Value Proposition (autopilot-led)

> **Dyna.ai delivers AI autopilot for contact center operations — outbound (telemarketing, collections, renewals, activation) and inbound (customer service, bookings, order handling). Human-like voice agents in 10+ languages, running 24/7. You pay for outcomes, not seats.**

### Positioning Statement

> For mid-market BPOs under pressure to deliver AI-enhanced service, Dyna.ai is the AI autopilot partner that replaces manual call volume with autonomous agents — not copilots, not tools, full execution. We bring deep operational expertise and outcome-aligned pricing to every deployment. We've proven this at enterprise scale with Teleperformance, major telecoms, and digital banks across three continents.

### Why "Autopilot" Matters (GLG Expert Insight)

The industry is moving through three distinct phases:
1. **Digital AI** (chat/email/text) — already being fully automated. 25-30% of industry volume.
2. **Copilot / Agent Assist** — cuts call time in half. Helpful but doesn't change the cost structure.
3. **Full Autopilot** (agentic AI) — complete replacement of human calls for defined workflows.

Most vendors are stuck at phase 2. **Dyna is one of the few companies that can deliver phase 3 at production scale.** This should be front and center in all messaging.

### Key Phrases to Use

| Phrase | When to Use |
|---|---|
| "AI Autopilot" | **Primary term.** Use this instead of "AI agents" or "copilots." It signals full execution, not just assistance. |
| "AI Workforce" | When talking about the broader vision. Replace "bots" or "tools" with this. |
| "Results as a Service" | When discussing pricing or business model. |
| "Full autopilot for outbound and inbound" | When describing what we do in one line. Mention both, emphasize outbound. |
| "Expand your capacity without adding headcount" | Core hook for COO/CFO. |
| "Transform your margin structure" | Core hook for CFO. Reference the 5-8% onshore EBITDA problem. |
| "We work with industry leaders like Teleperformance" | Credibility in any context. |
| "Outcome-aligned pricing" | When they ask about cost / pricing model. |
| "Production-grade" | When differentiating from DIY or startup competitors. |

### Key Phrases to Avoid

| Avoid | Why | Use Instead |
|---|---|---|
| "Copilot" / "Agent assist" | Undersells us — we do full autopilot | "AI autopilot" / "Full autonomous execution" |
| "Replace your agents" | Threatening, triggers resistance | "Handle more volume without adding headcount" |
| "Robo-calls" / "Bots" | Sounds cheap, low-quality | "AI autopilot" / "AI workforce" |
| "Cost cutting" (as the lead) | Too narrow — frame it as margin transformation | "Transform your margin structure" / "EBITDA expansion" |
| "We're a startup" | Undermines credibility | "We've deployed at enterprise scale" |
| "Our technology" | Too tech-focused | "Our operational expertise" |
| "SaaS platform" | Old model | "AI autopilot partner" |

## 4. Key Differentiators

### Why Dyna vs. Competitors

**1. Operational Expertise (Primary Differentiator)**
We don't just deploy technology — we design the call scripts, segment the workflows (e.g., DPD 30/60/90 day collection strategies with tone-adapted agents), and continuously optimize outcomes. Our team comes from BPO operations, not just software engineering.

**2. Production-Grade Reliability**
Competitors gluing together open-source stacks (ElevenLabs + dialer + basic prompting) typically reach 60-80% quality. Our purpose-built platform delivers 95%+ uptime with enterprise-grade monitoring, failover, and continuous agent optimization.

**3. Enterprise-Scale Track Record**
We run AI agents in production for Teleperformance, major telecoms (Saudi Arabia, Thailand, Mexico), digital banks, and insurance companies. 200K+ outbound calls per month in some deployments.

**4. Outcome-Aligned Pricing**
We offer task-based, role-based, or performance-based pricing. Clients can pay per call, per outcome, or through revenue sharing. This aligns our incentives and removes the risk for buyers.

**5. Multi-Language at Scale**
10+ languages in production today including English, Spanish, Arabic, Thai, Singlish, Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese, Indonesian, and more. Multi-agent orchestration with automatic language detection and routing.

### Competitive Positioning

| Competitor Type | Their Pitch | Our Counter |
|---|---|---|
| **DIY (BPO builds internally)** | "We can do this ourselves with ElevenLabs + a dialer" | "You'll get to 80%. The last 20% — uptime, script optimization, compliance, multi-language — is where it fails. We've already solved that." |
| **CCaaS adding AI features** (NICE, Five9, Genesys) | "We're adding AI to your existing platform" | "They're adding features to a legacy platform. We're purpose-built for AI-first operations. Different architecture, different outcomes." |
| **Pure AI voice vendors** (Vapi, PolyAI) | "We have the best voice tech" | "Voice quality is table stakes. The difference is operational expertise — knowing how to design scripts, segment audiences, and optimize for real business outcomes. We run full outbound operations, not just tech." |

### Tailoring by Delivery Model

Not all US-HQ BPOs operate the same way. ~54% are onshore-heavy; the rest deliver primarily through offshore (Philippines, India, South Africa) or nearshore (LATAM). The core templates work for both, but **swap in the right hook lines** based on their delivery footprint.

**How to tell:** Check the account's delivery footprint in the master list (onshore/nearshore/offshore columns). If unclear, their website usually says "offices in Manila" or "US-based agents" — that tells you.

#### Onshore-Heavy BPOs (US-based delivery, maybe some nearshore)

**Their reality:** Thin margins (5-8% EBITDA). Expensive US labor ($40-50K/seat/year). Every staffing mistake hurts. Clients demanding cost reductions they can't deliver without AI.

**The hook:** AI autopilot **fixes a broken margin structure.** This is existential for them.

Swap-in lines for Finance Leader:
> - "US onshore margins at 5-8% EBITDA don't leave room for error. AI autopilot transforms the unit economics of your onshore programs."
> - "You're paying $40-50K per seat per year onshore. Per-outcome AI runs at a fraction of that."

Swap-in lines for Operations Leader:
> - "Scaling onshore means opening new sites, hiring at US wages, and hoping attrition doesn't kill your ramp. AI autopilot eliminates that constraint."
> - "Your US-based team can focus on high-value, relationship-driven calls. AI handles the volume work."

#### Offshore-Heavy BPOs (Philippines, India, South Africa delivery)

**Their reality:** Healthy margins (20-55% EBITDA) from labor arbitrage. But clients are demanding AI-enhanced delivery. Competitors are offering AI. The threat isn't broken margins — it's **obsolescence**.

**The hook:** AI autopilot **protects your position and scales beyond what labor arbitrage can deliver.** If you don't offer AI, your clients will go to someone who does — or go direct to AI vendors.

Swap-in lines for Finance Leader:
> - "Labor arbitrage got you to 40% EBITDA. AI autopilot is the next lever — it scales volume without headcount, handles peaks without overtime, and gives clients the AI capability they're starting to demand."
> - "Your clients are evaluating whether to buy AI themselves and cut out the BPO entirely. Offering AI autopilot as part of your service is how you stay in the value chain."

Swap-in lines for Operations Leader:
> - "Even at offshore rates, 20-30% attrition means constant hiring and retraining. AI autopilot handles your most repetitive campaigns without turnover risk."
> - "Your offshore team handles the complex, relationship-driven work. AI autopilot takes the high-volume, scripted campaigns — collections reminders, booking confirmations, lead qualification — off their plate entirely."

#### Mixed Delivery (Onshore + Offshore)

**Their reality:** Sophisticated operators managing complex cross-border delivery. They already think in terms of optimizing which work goes where. AI is just another "delivery layer."

**The hook:** AI autopilot is a **third delivery tier** alongside onshore and offshore — the lowest cost, highest scale option for defined workflows.

Swap-in lines (any persona):
> - "You already optimize work across onshore and offshore. AI autopilot is the third tier — zero labor cost, infinite scale, per-outcome pricing. Route your most repetitive outbound and inbound workflows there."
> - "Think of AI autopilot as your most cost-effective site: it runs 24/7, never churns, speaks 10+ languages, and costs a fraction of even your offshore seats."

**Goal:** Get accepted. That's it. No pitch. No product. Just be human.

**Character limit:** 300 characters (LinkedIn limit with note).

#### If they might attend Enterprise Connect (default for all US):
> Hi [First Name] — heading to Enterprise Connect in Vegas next month. Great to meet fellow contact center leaders. Would love to connect!

#### If they're in the Southeast / CBAND Atlanta:
> Hi [First Name] — I'll be at the CCNG event in Atlanta on Feb 26. Would love to connect if you're in the area!

#### If neither event applies (fallback):
> Hi [First Name] — I spend my days working with BPO leaders on AI strategy for outbound ops. Would love to connect and compare notes.

---

### Touch 2: LinkedIn Message (after they accept)

**Goal:** Build rapport. Reference something personal. Plant the event seed. Offer value, not a pitch.

**Length:** 3-5 sentences. Conversational.

#### Template:

> Thanks for connecting, [First Name]!
>
> [ICEBREAKER — 1-2 sentences. Use the Icebreaker Insight column, or reference something from their profile/company. Be specific and genuine.]
>
> I've been spending a lot of time with mid-market BPO leaders exploring how AI voice agents are transforming outbound operations. Fascinating space right now.
>
> [EVENT HOOK — choose one:]
> - Are you planning to be at Enterprise Connect next month? Would be great to meet in person.
> - I'll be at the CCNG event in Atlanta on the 26th — would love to grab coffee if you're nearby.
> - Would love to share some of what I'm learning if you're ever up for a quick call.

- Production-grade voice AI for outbound
- Enterprise AI agents — not another demo
- The 60-80% problem in voice AI

> Hi [First Name],
>
> [ICEBREAKER or reference LinkedIn connection]
>
> I lead the US expansion for Dyna.ai — we build production-grade AI voice agents for contact center operations. I wanted to reach out because our approach to deployment might interest you.
>
> Most teams that try to build outbound AI internally — gluing together ElevenLabs, a dialer, and some prompting — get to about 60-80% quality. The last 20% (uptime, multi-language routing, script optimization, compliance controls) is where deployments fail in production.
>
> That's what we've solved. Our platform, Agent Studio, is purpose-built:
> - Flexible deployment: cloud, on-prem, or hybrid
> - 95%+ uptime with automatic failover
> - Low-code agent config with version control and one-click rollback
> - 10+ languages in production with automatic detection and routing
> - Built-in compliance controls, content guardrails, full audit trails
>
> We run voice agents at scale for Teleperformance, major telecoms, and digital banks across three continents.
>
> I'd value your perspective on what matters most for [Company]. Would you be open to a technical conversation?
>
> Best,
> Calanthia

### Touch 4: Email Nudge (if no reply)

**Goal:** Lighter touch. Lead with a proof point. Create curiosity.

**Subject:** Re: [original subject]

> Hi [First Name],
>
> Quick follow-up — thought this might be interesting context.
>
> [INSERT ONE RELEVANT PROOF POINT — choose based on persona and company:]
>
> **For Executive:** "One of the enterprise BPOs we work with went from a single collections pilot to deploying AI voice agents across three product lines in under 12 months. The conversation started exactly like this one."
>
> **For Operations/Finance:** "We recently helped a telecom run a 20,000-record upsell campaign with a dual-agent model (promotion agent + validation agent). 136 closed sales — fully automated, no human intervention during the call. On per-outcome pricing, the margin impact was immediate."
>
> **For Technology:** "Our inference engine reduced P99 latency by 10x and increased throughput by 3x compared to standard deployments. Happy to share the technical architecture if you're evaluating options."
>
> No pressure — just thought it might be useful. Happy to chat whenever timing works.
>
> Best,
> Calanthia

### When to Reference Teleperformance

Teleperformance is the biggest name we can drop. Use it:
- In the first email to Executive Sponsors (establishes enterprise credibility)
- When a prospect says "have you worked with anyone like us?"
- When they question whether AI can work at BPO scale
- **Note:** We can use the Teleperformance name and logo per contractual permission

## 7. Event Hooks

### Upcoming Events for Outreach

| Event | Date | Location | Use As Hook For |
|---|---|---|---|
| **CCNG / CBAND Atlanta** | Feb 26, 2026 | Atlanta, GA | Southeast contacts. Calanthia attending. |
| **Enterprise Connect** | Mar 10-12, 2026 | Las Vegas, NV | All US contacts. Major vendor-neutral event. |
| **ICMI Digital Experience** | Apr 8, 2026 | Virtual (free) | Lighter hook. "Are you tuning into ICMI next month?" |
| **Frost & Sullivan MindXchange** | Apr 12-15, 2026 | Fort Lauderdale, FL | Senior execs. Invite-style format. |
| **Customer Contact Week (CCW)** | Jun 22-25, 2026 | Las Vegas, NV | Biggest CC event. Use after initial contact established. |

### How to Use Events in Messaging

**LinkedIn connect:** Mention the event directly. "Heading to [Event] — would love to connect."

**LinkedIn message:** Ask if they're going. Offer to meet. "I'll be at Enterprise Connect next month — are you planning to go? Would be great to grab coffee."

**If they're going:** "Looking forward to seeing you there. Let's find 20 minutes to meet."

**If they're NOT going:** "I don't blame you — Vegas in March is a lot. Would you be up for a call instead? I can share my takeaways from the event afterwards."

**If they don't respond to the event hook:** Drop it. Move to email with persona-specific value prop.

- **Not:** "I'm a salesperson for an AI company"
- **Instead:** "I'm an AI entrepreneur who works with BPO leaders on outbound transformation"
- Tone: senior executive, industry expert, genuinely curious
- She's offering insights and perspective, not pitching a product
- She's in New York — that carries credibility in the US market

### Signature Block

## 9. Objection Handling Quick Reference

| Objection | Type | Response Framework |
|---|---|---|
| "We're already doing AI" | Deflection | "That's great — most BPOs we talk to have started with internal tools or copilots. Where we see the biggest gap is in outbound production. Are you running AI agents on live outbound campaigns today?" |
| "We're not ready for AI" | Timing | "That's actually the best time to start a pilot. A focused outbound deployment takes 30 days and gives you real data to build your AI strategy around — not theory." |
| "Send me some information" | Soft no | "Of course. But the most valuable thing I can share is what we're learning from deployments with operators like yours. Can we do 15 minutes so I can tailor what I send?" |
| "We tried AI and it didn't work" | Past failure | "That's more common than you'd think. Most pilots fail because of execution, not technology. Our approach is operationally led — we design the scripts and workflows, not just plug in tech. What did you try before?" |
| "We build our own tech" | DIY | "We see a lot of that. Teams usually get to 60-80% quality. The last 20% — uptime, compliance, multi-language, continuous optimization — is where it breaks in production. Happy to show you where the gap typically is." |
| "What's it cost?" | Premature pricing | "It depends on the use case and volume. We offer outcome-aligned pricing — you can pay per call, per successful outcome, or through revenue sharing. The point is you don't pay unless it works." |
| "I need to talk to my team" | Buying process | "Absolutely. Would it help if I put together a brief with the relevant case studies so you have something concrete to share? Who else would typically be involved in evaluating something like this?" |

## Appendix A: Industry Context for Conversations

### Talking Points About the Market

Use these when establishing credibility in conversations. Don't recite them — weave them naturally.

- **"The US contact center market is ~$80 billion and growing."** This is a massive industry. Not a niche. (GLG expert confirmed.)

- **"US onshore EBITDA margins are 5-8%. Nearshore is 20-30%. Offshore is 40-55%."** AI autopilot can reshape these economics entirely. One AI-first BPO is already running at 40% EBITDA margins. (GLG expert data.)

- **"Clients are writing 20% cost reductions into contracts over 3 years."** BPOs MUST find AI solutions or they can't meet contractual obligations. This creates urgency. (GLG expert confirmed.)

- **"25-30% of industry volume is digital (chat/email/text) and is already being automated."** Klarna eliminated 700 agent positions and saved $40M/year. This shocked the industry. Voice is next. (GLG expert example.)

- **"Mid-market BPOs can't build AI like Teleperformance can."** TP committed $185M to AI. Mid-market operators don't have that capital. They need external partners. That's us. (GLG expert insight.)

- **"Nearly 53% of contact centers with outbound capabilities already do telemarketing."** This isn't a niche offering — it's where the industry already operates. AI just removes the scaling constraint.

- **"The US controls global BPO distribution."** 83.7% of your priority accounts are US-HQ'd. Decisions are made here.

- **"AI autopilot gets performance reviews now."** This line (from the Narrative Workshop) is sticky and memorable. Use it when people ask "but how do you ensure quality?" The answer: the same way you manage human agents — KPIs, monitoring, continuous optimization.

### Conference Agenda Keywords (for credibility in conversations)

These topics dominate the 2026 US contact center conference circuit. Using them signals that you're plugged into the industry:

- AI acceleration — from pilot to pervasive
- The economics of AI to improve CX while reducing costs
- Where are the humans in the contact center of the future?
- Micro wins vs. moonshots in AI deployment
- Journey orchestration beyond the contact center
- Build vs. buy in AI strategy
- Integrations replacing monolithic systems

## Appendix B: Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Lead with **AI autopilot** — own this word. It's the strongest positioning we have.
- Mention **both outbound and inbound** capabilities, but **emphasize outbound** with specific use cases
- Talk about **margin and EBITDA** directly with COO and CFO — they care about numbers, not vision
- Frame AI as **margin transformation** (positive), not just cost cutting
- Reference **working with industry leaders like Teleperformance** early
- Use **events as conversation starters** — human, not salesy
- Personalize every message — use the **Icebreaker Insight column** from the contact list
- Position Calanthia as a **senior industry expert**, not a salesperson
- Mention **outcome-aligned pricing** — removes risk for the buyer
- Keep LinkedIn messages **short and conversational**
- Keep emails **under 150 words** for the first touch

### Don't
- Don't position as "copilot" or "agent assist" — that undersells us. We do **full autopilot**.
- Don't lead with product features or a demo offer
- Don't send the same message to all three personas
- Don't use "early access" framing (this was PH positioning — doesn't work for US)
- Don't position as "Silicon Valley startup" (US BPO leaders are skeptical of tech vendors)
- Don't mention compliance as a selling point yet (still being set up for US)
- Don't batch-send identical emails through HubSpot for the first cohort (personalize each one)
- Don't shy away from talking about **replacing manual volume** — C-suite doesn't care about protecting jobs, they care about margin (GLG expert confirmed)
- Don't use the term "APO Labs" — we are **Dyna.ai** in the US market
