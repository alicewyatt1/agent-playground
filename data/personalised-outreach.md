Hi Youssef,

Great connecting on LinkedIn! As BPOs face margin pressures, the capital gap can be daunting. While Teleperformance can invest heavily in AI, you don't have to. Our fully automated agents are tailor-made for operations like yours. We manage 10K+ daily calls with 99% accuracy and achieve 76% promise-to-pay in collections, while reducing inbound booking costs by 40%.

Would you be open to a 20-minute call to explore how we can drive similar results for Percepta?

Best,  
Calanthia
