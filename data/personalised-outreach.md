Hi Mark,

It was a pleasure connecting on LinkedIn. In my work with BPO leaders like Teleperformance, I've seen AI transform operations without needing a massive budget. For example, a major Mexican telco achieved 99% tagging accuracy using an automated dual-agent model. Similarly, a digital bank in Singapore improved its promise-to-pay rate by 76%. These results show how AI can enhance service quality while maintaining healthy margins. I'd be happy to share more of what I'm seeing — would you be interested in a conversation?

Hi Pankaj,

It was great connecting on LinkedIn. I've been working closely with BPO leaders on leveraging AI for enhanced service quality and cost efficiency. While Teleperformance has set the benchmark, you don't need their budget to achieve similar results. For instance, a digital bank in Singapore expanded from a pilot to a multi-product AI solution in 12 months, with impressive compliance and reach rates. 

AI is becoming a crucial third delivery tier, complementing onshore and offshore strategies with zero labor cost and infinite scalability. I'd be happy to share more of what I'm seeing—would you be interested in a conversation?

Hi Rob,

Great to connect on LinkedIn. I've been diving deep with BPO leaders on AI strategies, and I see similar challenges around margin pressure and ROI. Companies like Teleperformance are leading the way, but you don’t need their budget for success. Take, for example, a digital bank in Singapore that achieved a 76% promise-to-pay rate using AI — expanding from pilot to multi-product in a year. AI becomes a third delivery tier alongside onshore and offshore, offering zero labour cost and infinite scale.

Hi Keith,

Thanks for connecting on LinkedIn. At Dyna.ai, I've been working closely with BPO leaders like Teleperformance, helping them navigate the growing demand for high-quality, cost-effective services. For example, a digital bank in Singapore achieved a 76% promise-to-pay rate with our AI strategies. Similarly, a Mexican fintech lender saw a 25% responder rate improvement. These insights might be valuable as you manage operations at KM² Solutions. I'd be happy to share more of what I'm seeing — would you be interested in a conversation?

Subject: Elevating CX with AI: Insights from Industry Leaders

Hi Daniel,

Thanks for connecting on LinkedIn. I've been working closely with BPO leaders like Teleperformance to address the challenges of balancing CX quality with cost efficiency. For example, a major Mexican telco achieved 99% tagging accuracy and 4.7% conversion on telesales upsell through fully automated voice solutions. Similarly, a digital bank in Singapore expanded its AI-driven collections strategy, maintaining compliance and enhancing reach. These cases show how bespoke AI solutions can protect margins and scale beyond traditional labour arbitrage. 

I'd be happy to share more of what I'm seeing — would you be interested in a conversation?
