Hi Benjamin,

I enjoyed connecting on LinkedIn and was inspired by your insights on AI at the Customer Connect Expo.

For example, Teleperformance’s work with a digital bank in Singapore resulted in a 76% promise-to-pay rate — a testament to AI’s potential. AI agents offer scalable solutions beyond the typical onshore and offshore models. I'd be happy to share more of what I'm seeing — would you be interested in a conversation?
