Hi Mark,

Great to connect on LinkedIn! I've been working closely with BPO leaders like those at Teleperformance on integrating AI to enhance service quality and reduce costs. For instance, a major Mexican telco achieved 99% tagging accuracy and a 4.7% conversion rate with an automated model. Similarly, a digital bank in Singapore saw a 76% promise-to-pay rate, expanding rapidly across products.

I'd be happy to share more of what I'm seeing — would you be interested in a conversation?

Hi Amanda,

Thanks for connecting on LinkedIn. I've been working closely with BPO leaders like those at Teleperformance, helping them navigate AI's role in enhancing operations. For example, a digital bank in Singapore achieved a 76% promise-to-pay rate using AI in collections, expanding rapidly from pilot to full-scale.

Similarly, a digital bank in Singapore expanded its AI pilot to a multi-product solution, achieving a 76% promise-to-pay rate.

You don't need Teleperformance's budget to access these insights. We bring the same expertise to you. I'd be happy to share more of what I'm seeing — would you be interested in a conversation?

For instance, a digital bank in Singapore used AI to achieve a 76% promise-to-pay rate, expanding from pilot to multi-product in a year. AI is becoming a third delivery tier — "zero labour cost, infinite scale, per-outcome pricing." I'd be happy to share more of what I'm seeing — would you be interested in a conversation?

Great to connect, David. Your expansion in Grenada is truly inspiring. I've been spending a lot of time with BPO leaders, diving into AI strategies for voice operations. Curious about your thoughts on the future of AI in BPOs. Are you going to the CCNG event in Atlanta on Feb 26?

Hi David,

Wonderful connecting with you on LinkedIn! Your recent expansion in the Caribbean is a testament to KM² Solutions' leadership. I've been working closely with BPO leaders, like those at Teleperformance, who are leveraging AI for enhanced service quality. For instance, a digital bank in Singapore expanded their AI pilot to a multi-product solution within a year, achieving a 76% promise-to-pay rate. You don't need Teleperformance's budget to scale AI solutions — we bring the expertise to you. I'd be happy to share more of what I'm seeing — would you be interested in a conversation?

Warm regards,  
Calanthia

Great to connect, Youssef. With Thomas Monaghan stepping in at Percepta, it seems like an interesting time for new strategies. I've been spending time with BPO leaders discussing AI's role in operations. Are you going to the CCNG event in Atlanta on Feb 26?

Subject: Insights on AI for BPO Leaders

Hi Youssef,

Thanks for connecting on LinkedIn. As Percepta navigates new leadership, I've been working closely with BPO leaders like Teleperformance, who are leveraging AI to meet demanding service quality at lower costs. One relevant example is a digital bank in Singapore achieving a 76% promise-to-pay rate in a regulated environment, all without an internal AI team. Similarly, a major Middle East airline saw a 40% labor cost reduction through AI.

I'd be happy to share more of what I'm seeing — would you be interested in a conversation?

Warm regards,

Hi Ken,

It was great connecting on LinkedIn. Your leadership in launching NinjaAI is inspiring. I've been working closely with BPO leaders like those at Teleperformance on similar challenges, seeing how AI can transform operations. For example, a digital bank in Singapore achieved a 76% promise-to-pay rate by expanding from a pilot to a multi-product solution within a year. Similarly, a Mexican fintech improved collections with tailored tone adaptation strategies.

I'd be happy to share more of what I'm seeing — would you be interested in a conversation?

Hi Benjamin,

Thanks for connecting on LinkedIn. Your work on balancing AI with human agents at The Office Gurus is impressive. I've been working closely with BPO leaders like Teleperformance on similar challenges. For instance, a digital bank in Singapore expanded from a pilot to a multi-product AI offering in just 12 months. AI is becoming a third delivery tier alongside onshore and offshore, providing zero labor cost and infinite scale. I'd be happy to share more of what I'm seeing — would you be interested in a conversation?

Subject: Scaling BPO Excellence with AI Insights

Hi Dominic,

I’m delighted to connect with you on LinkedIn. Having worked closely with leaders at Teleperformance and other BPO giants, I've seen how AI is transforming our industry. For instance, a major telecom in Mexico achieved a 99% tagging accuracy and 4.7% conversion on telesales upsell with an automated model. You don’t need Teleperformance’s budget to leverage similar expertise — Dyna's team offers scalable solutions for mixed delivery models like yours.

I'd be happy to share more of what I'm seeing — would you be interested in a conversation?

Warm regards,
