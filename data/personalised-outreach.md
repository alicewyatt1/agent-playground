Hi Mark,

Thanks for connecting on LinkedIn. I've been working closely with BPO leaders like those at Teleperformance on leveraging AI to reduce labor costs while scaling operations. For example, a major Mexican telco achieved 4.7% conversion on telesales upsells using AI-driven dual-agent models, and a digital bank in Singapore expanded AI solutions to handle multi-product collections with a 76% promise-to-pay rate.

I'd be happy to share more of what I'm seeing — would you be interested in a conversation?

Hi Donny,

Thanks for connecting on LinkedIn. Working with BPO giants like Teleperformance, I've seen how AI can transform operations by reducing labor costs and expanding capacity. For instance, a digital bank in Singapore reached a 76% promise-to-pay rate with AI, significantly enhancing efficiency.

With Helpware’s diverse service portfolio, AI could be your third delivery tier, offering zero labor cost and infinite scale. I'd be happy to share more of what I'm seeing — would you be interested in a conversation?

Warm regards,
