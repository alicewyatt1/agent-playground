Hi Ken,

Thanks for connecting on LinkedIn. Your leadership in launching NinjaAI at SupportNinja is inspiring. I've been collaborating with BPO leaders on AI adoption, including Teleperformance, to transform contact centers. Recently, I worked with a digital bank in Singapore, achieving a 76% promise-to-pay rate with AI. Similarly, a major Mexican telco automated 10K+ daily calls with 99% accuracy.

AI can redefine your tech landscape, offering enterprise-grade solutions without needing an internal AI team. I'd be happy to share more of what I'm seeing—would you be interested in a conversation?

Warm regards,  
Calanthia
