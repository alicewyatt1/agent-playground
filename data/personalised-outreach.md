Hi Demond,  
Thanks for connecting! Percepta's focus on automotive customer loyalty is impressive. I'm keen to learn more about your approach. Will you be at the CCNG event in Atlanta? If not, happy to share insights from my network on customer experience trends.

Hi Demond,

It was great connecting on LinkedIn. With the competitive pressures in customer service, leveraging AI can enable companies like Percepta to scale efficiently without increasing headcount. I've seen organizations handle 10K daily calls with 99% accuracy, enhancing customer loyalty. Could we schedule a 20-minute call to discuss how these strategies might work for Percepta?

Best,
