Hi Mark, impressed by Buwelo's 94% client retention and low attrition. Would love to connect and exchange insights on AI in BPO operations.

**Touch 2 — LinkedIn Message**  
Great to connect, Mark. Your experience with managing call centers for 5M+ customers annually is impressive. I've been spending a lot of time with BPO leaders discussing AI strategies for voice operations. Are you going to the CCNG event in Atlanta on Feb 26?

**Touch 3 — Email**  
Subject: Insights on AI Strategies in BPO Operations

Hi Mark,

It was great connecting on LinkedIn. I've been working closely with BPO leaders like those at Teleperformance, exploring how AI can drive service levels while managing costs. For instance, a major Mexican telco achieved a 99% tagging accuracy and 4.7% telesales upsell conversion. Similarly, a digital bank in Singapore expanded from pilot to multi-product in 12 months with a 76% promise-to-pay rate. These examples show AI's potential beyond just labor arbitrage. I'd be happy to share more of what I'm seeing — would you be interested in a conversation?

Warm regards,

Hi Erika,

It was great connecting on LinkedIn! I've been working closely with BPO leaders like Teleperformance on AI strategies for voice operations. Many are finding it challenging to balance service quality with cost, using AI to bridge that gap. For example, a digital bank in Singapore expanded their AI collections to a multi-product environment within a year, achieving a 76% promise-to-pay rate. At Teleperformance, we've seen similar success with a major telecom automating 10K+ daily calls. I'd be happy to share more of what I'm seeing — would you be interested in a conversation?

Hi Donny,

It was great connecting on LinkedIn. I've been working closely with BPO leaders like Teleperformance on AI integration for voice operations. Many are facing similar challenges—clients demanding more for less, and AI is becoming a crucial component. For instance, a digital bank in Singapore expanded from a pilot to multi-product in just 12 months with AI, achieving a 76% promise-to-pay rate. Another case with a major Mexican telco saw 99% tagging accuracy and significant telesales conversion through automation.

I'd be happy to share more of what I'm seeing—would you be interested in a conversation?
