Hi Jim, 

I noticed we're both speaking at the Conversational AI & Contact Center Innovation Summit this coming April. It's always exciting to share a virtual stage with someone whose work I admire. Given our mutual connections like Mark Escueta and Alon Waks, it seems we move in similar circles. I'm curious, what trends in AI and customer experience are catching your interest these days?

Hi Jim,

With both of us speaking at the Conversational AI Summit next month, I thought it might be worth connecting beforehand. I've been spending a lot of time with BPO leaders — including the team at Teleperformance — on what's actually working in outbound voice operations. The gap between the hype and what delivers in production is fascinating. I'd love to compare notes over coffee if you're open to it.

Warm regards,
