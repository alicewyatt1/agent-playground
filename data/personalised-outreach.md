Hi Keith,

Hi Daniel,

It was great connecting on LinkedIn. I've been working closely with leaders at Teleperformance and others on leveraging AI for BPOs. Your clients demand high service quality at lower costs; AI can deliver both. For instance, a major Mexican telco achieved a 99% tagging accuracy and 4.7% telesales conversion using AI.

AI protects your position in an offshore-heavy model and scales beyond what labor arbitrage delivers. I'd be happy to share more of what I'm seeing — would you be interested in a conversation?

Warm regards,

And a digital bank in Singapore saw a 40% reach rate with AI in collections.

These examples show that you don't need Teleperformance's budget to leverage AI effectively. I'd be happy to share more of what I'm seeing—would you be interested in a conversation?
