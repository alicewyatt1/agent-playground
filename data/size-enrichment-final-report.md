## Key Findings

### Critical Classification Errors Found

1. **Teleperformance** - Listed as "Mid Market" but is actually one of the world's LARGEST BPOs with 360,000-500,000 employees globally. This was a major data quality issue.

2. **Account Management Systems** - Listed as "Mid Market (1,000-5,000)" but has fewer than 25 employees.

3. **Multiple Enterprise → Super Enterprise** - Seven companies classified as "Enterprise (5,000+)" actually have 50,000+ employees and should be Super Enterprise.

### Companies No Longer Operating Independently

- **Convergys**: Acquired by Concentrix in 2018
- **Webhelp**: Merged with Concentrix in 2023

### Data Quality Notes

- Some sources show conflicting employee counts (e.g., CIENCE shows 69 on ZoomInfo but 201-500 on other sources)
- Employee counts can fluctuate significantly for BPOs due to project-based work
- Agent/seat counts may differ from direct employee counts

4. **Consider adding "Super Enterprise" category** to the size schema permanently
5. **Review Teleperformance classification** - this was a significant data quality issue
