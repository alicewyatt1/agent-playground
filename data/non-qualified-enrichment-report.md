## Key Findings

1. **Overwhelming majority correctly classified**: 1,279 of 1,289 (99.2%) non-qualified accounts are SME, and this is correct based on research.

2. **Only 2 reclassifications needed**: Liveops (2,467-2,700 employees) and NexRep (612-1,072 employees) should be reclassified from SME to Mid Market.

3. **5 borderline cases**: Demandbase, Anequim, IntelliSource, Clear Harbor, and BELAY are at the upper boundary of SME (750-1,000 employees) but don't clearly exceed 1,000.

4. **8 Unknown accounts resolved**: All 8 accounts with unknown size are small medical billing or specialty companies that fit the SME category.

5. **No large players found**: Unlike the Qualified list (which had Teleperformance misclassified as Mid Market when it has 410,000+ employees), the non-qualified list has no major BPO companies hiding among the SMEs.

6. **Data availability limited**: Most small BPO and call center companies have limited public data on employee counts, making verification difficult.

## Data Quality Notes

- **Most SME companies have limited public employee data** - small operations often have <50 employees with minimal online presence
- **Contractor vs. employee counting varies** - companies like BELAY and Liveops have large contractor networks that may or may not be counted as "employees"
- **Virtual/remote workforce reporting differs** - some companies report "agents" or "virtual assistants" separately from employees
- **Estimates from business intelligence platforms vary** - Growjo, ZoomInfo, RocketReach often show conflicting figures

## Sources Used

- ZoomInfo employee counts
- RocketReach company profiles
- Growjo company data

## Comparison: Qualified vs Non-Qualified Enrichment

| Metric | Qualified Accounts | Non-Qualified Accounts |
|--------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Total Accounts | 131 | 1,289 |
| Category Changes | 36 (27%) | 2 (0.16%) |
| SME | 64 (49%) | 1,285 (99.7%) |
| Mid Market | 32 (24%) | 4 (0.3%) |
| Enterprise | 20 (15%) | 0 (0%) |
| Super Enterprise | 12 (9%) | 0 (0%) |
| Acquired/Merged | 3 (2%) | 0 (0%) |

**Key Insight**: The non-qualified list is almost entirely SME companies, while the qualified list has significant representation across all size categories. This makes sense - larger companies are more likely to be qualified as they have broader service offerings and market presence.

---

## Recommendations

1. **Apply the 2 category changes** - Reclassify Liveops and NexRep from SME to Mid Market

2. **Assign SME to 8 Unknown accounts** - All are small medical billing companies

3. **Monitor borderline cases** - Demandbase, Anequim, IntelliSource, Clear Harbor, and BELAY may cross into Mid Market as they grow

4. **Consider Liveops and NexRep for Qualified status** - Both are substantial virtual call center operations that may warrant qualification review

5. **No further action needed for vast majority** - The 1,279 SME accounts are correctly classified
