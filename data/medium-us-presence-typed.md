- **Offshore**: Delivery to US from outside the US (e.g. Philippines, India, Cayman, Australia); “US parent” = US HQ with offshore delivery arm.
- **Nearshore**: Not used here; none clearly nearshore-only from the list.
- **Unclear**: Name/location doesn’t clearly indicate HQ vs nearshore vs offshore.
- **Questionable**: US presence is secondary (e.g. UK HQ with some US operations).
