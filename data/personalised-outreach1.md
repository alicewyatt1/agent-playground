| **LinkedIn** | https://www.linkedin.com/in/jimiyoob |
| **Email** | jim.iyoob@etechgs.com |

**Note for Calanthia:** Jim is not a typical executive prospect. He runs ETS Labs (Etech's AI/innovation arm), keynotes on AI leadership, and is deeply technical. He doesn't need educating on AI or FOMO — he's already all-in. Treat this as a peer-to-peer conversation about what Dyna has built technically, and ask for his perspective genuinely. Different tone from every other prospect.

**Outreach hooks:**

1. **Speaking/event:** CONFIRMED SPEAKER at Conversational AI & Contact Center Innovation Summit (Virtual, Apr 9). Also keynoting Call Center Campus Symposium (May 17-20) on "Prickly Truths: Leadership Readiness in the Age of AI." Also leading CCW Las Vegas workshop (Jun 23) on turning CX challenges into growth using AI, analytics, and human intelligence.

I'd be interested in your take on where the production gaps still are. I'll be at Enterprise Connect next month — will you be there? |
| **3** | Email | Hi Jim, Given your work at ETS Labs, I thought this would be relevant. At Dyna, we've built fully automated voice AI that manages entire calls independently — greeting to resolution — across inbound and outbound. Not copilot, not agent-assist. Full execution. We're already deployed at production scale with Teleperformance, across telecom, lending, insurance, travel, and restaurant verticals. Multi-agent orchestration, multi-language, enterprise-grade reliability. I'll be at Enterprise Connect in Las Vegas next month. Would you be interested in meeting there? Warm regards, Calanthia |

I'm now bringing best-in-class enterprise AI solutions at Dyna to improve operational performance and efficiency at call centers. The Operations leaders I'm working with are trying to hit SLAs and conversion targets while managing high churn, rising labor costs, and unpredictable volumes. Dyna is already deployed in high-volume enterprise environments, including Teleperformance and delivers: - Meaningful cost reduction without compromising service quality - Elastic agent capacity that doesn't churn or require ramp time - Fully automated voice AI agents running 24/7 with high uptime and accuracy - Deep operational expertise across Telecom, Lending, Insurance, Consumer Goods, Travel, Restaurants, and other high-volume industry use cases I'll be at the CCNG event in Atlanta on Feb 26 meeting with a number of BPO leaders. Would you be interested in meeting there? Warm regards, Calanthia |
