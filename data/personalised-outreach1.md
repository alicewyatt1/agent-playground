[Personalise here based on hooks above.]

I've spent the last decade founding and scaling technology businesses in Silicon Valley through two exits. I'm now bringing best-in-class enterprise AI solutions at Dyna AI to fully automate call center inbound and outbound operations.

The executives I am working with are under pressure to improve margin while maintaining service quality, but without the capital or internal AI teams of the largest BPOs.

Already used by Teleperformance, Dyna AI is now bringing voice AI solutions to all contact centers looking to:
- Run inbound and outbound calls end-to-end
- Scale operations 24/7 without additional headcount
- Tie performance directly to revenue expansion and improved margins
- Deploy use-case proven AI across Telecom, Lending, Insurance, Consumer Goods, Travel, Restaurants and other high-volume verticals

I'll be at the CCNG event in Atlanta on Feb 26 meeting with a few BPO leaders. Would you be interested in meeting there?

Warm regards,
Calanthia |
