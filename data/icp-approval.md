| **Mid-market BPO pressures**          | Mid-market BPOs are the most vulnerable to AI disruption:     |
|                                       | they lack the capital to build their own AI (unlike           |
|                                       | Teleperformance, who committed $185M to internal AI), but     |

|                                       | service — and competitors who adopt AI will deliver both.     |
|                                       | They need external AI partners.                               |

| **Overall value proposition**         | Full autopilot for your contact centre — outbound and         |
|                                       | inbound. Replace manual volume with AI agents that run 24/7   |
|                                       | and get measured on results.                                  |

## Persona 1: Executive Sponsor

+---------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                       |                                                               |
+=======================================+===============================================================+
| **Titles**                            | CEO, Founder, Owner, Chairman, President, Co-Founder & CEO,   |
|                                       | Managing Partner                                              |
+---------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Role in deal**                      | Economic buyer. Owns capital allocation decisions. Final       |
|                                       | budget authority. Accountable to board/investors for margin    |
|                                       | expansion, competitive positioning, and long-term valuation.  |
+---------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+

**What they care about:**

- **Staying competitive:** Clients are pushing for cost reductions and better service quality — BPOs that can't deliver both will lose contracts to those that can.
- **Market positioning:** Being seen as AI-forward, not left behind. The industry is moving and standing still is a risk.
- **Client retention:** Some clients are starting to evaluate going direct to AI vendors or building their own capabilities, cutting the BPO out entirely.
- **Improving EBITDA:** Finding ways to structurally improve margins, not just incremental cost savings.

**Their success metrics:** Revenue growth, EBITDA margin, new client acquisition, client retention rate, AI strategy credibility with boards.

**Core message to them:**

> Your clients want higher quality and lower cost — and your competitors are starting to use AI to deliver on that. The BPOs that move to AI autopilot now will win on cost and quality and keep those contracts. We deploy AI autopilot for outbound and inbound operations, allowing you to scale on demand without headcount.

**Key proof points:** Teleperformance / Sands Macau (enterprise credibility, multi-language); IZZI telesales upsell (4.7% conversion, fully automated); Digital Bank Singapore (pilot-to-scale in 12 months, 76% promise-to-pay).

## Persona 2: Operations & Finance Leader

+---------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                       |                                                               |
+=======================================+===============================================================+
| **Titles**                            | COO, CFO, VP Operations, SVP Operations, VP Client Services,  |
|                                       | SVP Client Services, VP of Business Operations, EVP           |
|                                       | Operations, VP Client Solutions, VP Finance, Regional VP      |
+---------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Role in deal**                      | COO = Champion who drives evaluation and owns operational     |
|                                       | outcome. CFO = Margin holder who validates the business case  |
|                                       | and approves spend.                                           |
+---------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+

**What they care about:**

- **Service quality:** Hitting client SLAs and conversion targets.
- **Protecting EBITDA:** High margin pressure from labour costs, and scaling revenue is dependent on scaling headcount.
- **Staffing correctly:** Overstaffing kills margin, understaffing kills SLAs; constant challenge given high annual attrition (20–30%+ is typical in the industry).
- **Forecast accuracy:** Aligning workforce planning with unpredictable call / outbound volumes.
- **Avoiding operational disruption:** Ensuring any new innovation must not jeopardise existing SLAs or client relationships.

**Their success metrics:** EBITDA margin (by site, by client, by program), conversion rate (outbound), resolution rate, revenue per seat per year, daily volume capacity and utilisation rate, SLA adherence and client contract renewal rate.

**Core message to them:**

> AI autopilot gives you capacity that doesn't churn, doesn't need ramping and meets SLAs. We deploy fully autonomous agents for outbound and inbound that run 24/7 in multiple languages alongside your existing team. You keep staffing lean, protect your margin and scale on demand without the hiring gamble. Your costs flex with your client's demand.

**Key proof points:** Megacable (10K+ daily outbound, 99% tagging accuracy); Viraal collections (tone-adapted by DPD stage, 25% responder rate); Digital Bank Singapore (76% promise-to-pay, regulated environment); Airline Saudi Arabia (85%+ booking success, 40% labour cost reduction).

## Persona 3: Technology Leader

+---------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                       |                                                               |
+=======================================+===============================================================+
| **Titles**                            | CTO, CIO, VP Technology, VP Engineering, VP Software          |
|                                       | Engineering, CISO, VP IT, VP Digital Innovation               |
+---------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Role in deal**                      | Technical gatekeeper. Blocks or approves based on             |
|                                       | feasibility, security, and integration.                       |
+---------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+

**What they care about:**

- **Security, data privacy, and compliance:** One breach and the company is done. PCI-DSS, HIPAA (depending on clients), state-level regulations.
- **System reliability and uptime:** If the phones go down, nothing else matters. This is the baseline expectation.
- **Integration with existing stack:** They're running Genesys, Amazon Connect, Zendesk, or similar. Anything new must work with what they have.
- **Total cost of ownership:** Limited budget, small team, but expected to deliver innovation. They can't build like Teleperformance.

**Their success metrics:** Integration time and deployment speed, uptime and system reliability, security incidents (zero tolerance).

**Core message to them:**

> Our platform is enterprise-ready — used by the largest contact centres including Teleperformance. Deploy on cloud, on-prem, or hybrid. Enterprise-grade uptime with built-in compliance controls, content guardrails, and full audit trails. Deployments are API-first — integrates via SIP for telephony and API for CRM (Cisco and custom platforms). Secure by design, minimal internal engineering lift.

**Key proof points:** HSBC Copilot POC (98.6% factualness vs 67.5% competitor, head-to-head benchmark); S-Telco Saudi Arabia (Cisco integration, local cloud deployment, multi-language); Digital Bank Singapore (12-month production stability, continuous expansion).
